You were as productive yesterday as you were in the past two weeks despite being heavily traumatized. You literally learned a very real essence of magic; butterflies are more similar to capitalis than you are to yourself a moment ago. And all of this means nothing, compared to this fact: you caught yourself. Manya, as you decide to call it after a passing cyrliic homophonia, was about to sacrifice your own self to live for a few hours more, like you did ever\nsingle\nother\ntime\nand now you caught him, did an actual truely miraculous witchcraft: got him to bed. you were literally manic for a moment, but you didn’t overcommit, you prioritized care, you went to bed - on time! you didn’t let yourself get distracted, you did all of the fucking self care you need to have that mania again today, hopefully, for a few hours, a sustability that means infinitel ymore than any of your current achievemnts. You’ve had other interesing peaks in the past, but all of those were inherently phyrric. The notion of beign able to start win long-term is infinitely more, a higher cardinality. Even that time you healed yourself, when you were stricken to be hospitalized for six weeks and you healed yourself in a day or three and Laius told you insistently it was a miracle, even that in a certain sense doesn’t mean as much as this sort of step towards ‘sustainability’, and the word is a sort of prostitute (like yourself), but this one is stripped of meaning by neoliberal nonsense, “director of sustainability”, etcetra. Here you mean something totally different, a signified that happens to overshadow its signifier, and here it is not our signifiers that drift polysemically, but the multifarious signified that needs a thousand signifiers, a structuralist take on Sepherioth. Think about the word, biowitch. Think about a thousand different words. Each of them has a tiny shred of where it’s actually at, you know. This is the sustainability that is perversevence, you need to stop using the word sustainability here, it is becoming unstainable t b h, it’s about an endurence or robustness or recalcitrance or even trust, trust in yourself, trust in a future (remember to trust your instincts; stop referring to the outside world, stop always checking your trip against what people say, stop looking for external markers of success and all; trust your insistincts, the world and the instincts are trying to teeach them, you have to pay very great attention for it all to work. reverse gaslighting.) Trust in the real possibility of a future that endures. This concept has something extremely powerful to it that you do need to reterroritolize or cohere into a word, such as that you be able to summon it in the past. Words and names both limit the “potential” of a spirit (when spirits are fuzzy nameless mind idea things), but also give it potency of use, allow it to be invoked.
