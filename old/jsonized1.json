I will not even recreate the joyousness of arriving, of home, of Mile End, of that other clich\u00e9e stuff, this awkward cis roomierommie nor the weird-ass backwards swastikas on his art. The figure of Laius towers over this leap, this reterritorialization; together we sing that duet of turning over the chariot and building a pillow fort on it, sacking it, setting it on fire, signing the camp songs. Laius chastises me for considering campsongs as a form-of-life, tells me the Earth is Flat, there are twelve dimensions, the soul is infinite; and the echo of Ginsburg\u2019s asylum mother tells me that beat poetry sucks. In my other ear Claudius\u2019 brother pours poison: there is neither subject nor fixed identity, only partial objects produced by encounters between machines. I tell Laius that there is a context, a vibe, a spirit to camp songs, and they and their artifacts are meaningless without getting into their spirit. He answers me softly, rips my bike off the roof. We embrace.\r\n[day 1]",

Your sense of terrible impatience is tempered, in turn, by a total inability to squeeze paint in the amounts you mean, the paint falls out the tube like vomit and diarhea, incontinent, and you so hate to waste it, you need to make something, but nothing is at all the way you want it, everything, always, is Too Much, so much the time too much going away, worryingly, Too Much. You wonder what drugs to do tomorrow, wonder blankly minding your own and other\u2019s business. Your dad, the vague shape of Laius drifting across him but slowly becoming unfixed, the key turning the roman a clef into Guillaume Morissette's indictment of a personal essay, a creative non-ficton the all the other authors condemn you too, your dad asks you to find a product on Etsy that a client asked him to buy for her, the client. You mind other people\u2019s business, hoping that the distractions of this do turn \u201cPortrait of the ADHD artist in shitposts\u201d, or whatever that guy who keeps making kinda stupid kinda vaguely irritiating comments on your posts but you keep him around dispite not liking it very much because sometimes they are very validating, what did he say that portrait was? Anyway, we get it, you\u2019re very easily distracted and you\u2019re oh-so-clever in conveying this distraction to us instead of doing it the other way round and having the text sort and iron out your thoughts, the thoughts force the text and the syntax and the whole blessed thing into a perversion made partially bearable by memes, like utterly gros synthetic matter taking on the appearance of a food through the clever application of food coloring and the like. We\u2019re very cheerful about ourselves today, enjoying all the praise that\u2019s been heaped upon you. We enter into a conversation again, hope that maybe someday these two characters, the \u2018i\u2019 and the \u2018you\u2019, will finally hook up and then mill around awkwardly in the morning. What of it.\n[day like 8, ??]",

        "my roommate kicks everyone out from the sex party, entrusting them with photos, paintings of different modes of complexity along their surfaces, sex toys of various denominations, and misbegotten socks. One leaves a painting with her, but she rests it on my parent\u2019s kitchen table and disappears to make pasta out of LSD in frustration.\n\n        She stands there near the door of the window, looking at the stove, and the steam covers her eyes, searing the glasses with bits of sky, but the air in between us attacks me. It\u2019s cold. I\u2019m not going to talk to her. She turns around, reaches inside the fridge, and as her body twists back towards me\u2015\nHer glance catches me, but I\u2019m already a stone, and nobody minds.\n\n        The thing is, I don\u2019t have a roommate. In the future, my roommates will all be men, and I will bleed myself out at their convex nature, and then at my own insistent, pervasive essentialism (that men are convex). In the past, my roommates have all been subtle figures that certainly do not scream into my dreams -- only into poems and graffiti. They\u2019re polite like that, well-behaved, having learned their manners and mannerisms in the greatest school on earth, no place in particular. We are only left to conclude that this roommate is perhaps a great circuitous demon, a mermaid (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430) slipped from the mossy branches of my family tree/flowchart. Certainly she there does not resemble any other roommate, and soon I will destroy the roof of my mouth sucking the cracks in her construction.\n        \n        Regarding those different modes of painting, their is no longer a good and evil in this world, but a flatness which is also a depth and a complexity which is also a surface. It is not intuitive, but the geometric shapes tend themselves towards flatness, and the spontaneous length of time is an incomprehensible complexity, much like this one. Self-reflection is dizzying; my chest clenches up considering what the future might hold. I desist. \n        \n        Her pasta was no better than stone soup, obviously. It seethed into the air, we peppered it with salt, it made no sense, it was a Jesuit miracle. The latter we knew intimately, as a rugged salt-n-pepper figure would shout every morning from the rooftops, silhouetted there against the shivering sun groaning pastels through mist: \u201cI believe that Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish - but I don\u2019t believe they were all satisfied,\u201d over and over again as the crowds teemed their way to work.\n[day 1]",

        "I tell the world:\n\n\n\n\nMy initial motivation for this is a desire to read Deleuze, to read all the theory, and a frustrated at its inaccessibility. In general, books and essays seem to tend towards linearity, contextual isolation/segregation, de facto burying themselves with prerequisites. I want to fragment these texts, make it immediate, non-linear, concise, easily re-contextualizable, social, promiscuous, rhizomatic.\nI have no single vision for implementing this, and greatly want to hear people's ideas.\nOne way for implementing this is to have embodied readings or projects that leave traces or notes matching these criteria.\nAnother, probably too restrictive and problematic vision of this is a hypertext of fragments, where a given text becomes fragments linked:\n- sequentially, going from one sentence to the next, or the previous\n- topically, going from a fragment to other fragments on the same ideas. One way to partially implement this automatically is by reverse-indexing the text, linking each page to other pages under the same index heading. I have a really shoddily-done mockup of this at https://glycan.github.io/kplat.html\n- by level of detail: paragraphs, sections, chapters, texts concisely represented (e.g. summarized or abridged) as fragments (i.e. each group of fragments has a single, more accessible fragment summarizing it). This goes from least detailed (the summary of an entire text) to most detailed (gloss, commentary, and references for individual sentences). It seems like this would allow a reader to nigh-immediately seize the most relevant parts, making it possible to connect them with other ones from totally different disciplines without the barrier to entry of the discipline's groundwork.\n(Through these fragments, the entirety of each text can be accessed)\n[day like 8, ??]",

I say, \u201ci will start measuring events, whether i should go a certain event, by asking: will i get more out of this than staying here and painting?\u201d I can\u2019t paint; i also can\u2019t write: my shitposts at least are tightly edited, but this current nonsense here sprawls itself into length and I ignore the acutely intense finesse of sentence order and marks. But not knowing how to paint (not knowing how to live) you go up and paint an intensity, and how do you do it? You know about contrast, you set the oppositions up, you set the bright spontaneous burst against the structures darkly, and really all of the effort goes into the details of the structures. You snap out of it, out of time, into the world, and your therapist, who at this point is literally a beeping smartphone, tells you that time flies and sets scheduling the future, where we will have no electricity for ten days and ten nights, or maybe forty, but really it\u2019s just next monday.

Ritalin was\u2026 1, so first peak is 3-4 (more on this later), valley around 5 (is it about half an hour on each side?) and the second peak must 7-8? that would be right after therapy, therapy being a whole nother immense painful thought. There is an immensity of sky, entirely full of different tones. You seem to have lost familiarity with everything while you were tripping: now the same old tree branch silhouettes against the sky (did you miss the sunset again, or was it simply canceled? you definitely missed the sunbathing you were going to do). Your palms are sweaty against the white plastic of the laptop now, heavily so. The trees sprout from the college, both shillouettes. You fix it with the camera, and there are spots of explosions over it you didn\u2019t see with your own eyes (the streetlamps, comparatively invisible to humans. We never did finish up the transhumanist segment, did we). You even eventually get the focus right, catch a car speeding by as a blurr that you didn\u2019t see in real life either. The texture of a cloud looms up way too close, invading your personal space, the texture cropped (truncated? you search for the word for a minute) by another building, the one that\u2019s all mirrors (and the mirrors are little slits of cloud, too). You go to try to get food in a place full of panic at everyone who looks like an adult (you were arrested here two years ago, and banned, but they don\u2019t know shit except for the manager who yelled at you once).

The senses of the body, the feelings of light, little emotions with the baseline and longititude/longitutde feeling of the head, the sickness in the head, the length of the sicknesses, their temporailty/temporality, the gross invisible parts\u2026. this is a privelege/privledge/privilege, isn\u2019t it, of coming up against and dismissing all of the cognitive things, of gritting teeth occasionally to put them off and away; it is me being saved, it is an egotism and blindness on my part (to satisfy the total egoist: it a shortcoming of my art if am aware of my privilege yet remain passive in the face of something real going on. and since when do you care about art? well, since you started doing drugs, basically.

Across the street in the dark is a rough wooden fence, cyclopic, two rough people in front of. The cop shows up to investigate we shut something down. I no longer remember what. Obviously, the entire thing was a skit set up in case the cop would come, but it is still surprising we managed to hide whatever it was we were doing. The cop goes back and forth between the two of us and asks questions about our personalitiy profiles or so, our relations -- there is maybe two or three of us involved on the riverbank, and two of us near the fence, and we volley the cop between us as the headlights bore the through the raindrops.\nLater on, I tell someone I am good at containing things, I enjoy dealing with things, but she is incredulous - \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d my example involves shoes for some reason, and she quickly pokes a hole in my logic: what if you had 48 if them? it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re boots or high heels. I sigh and no, she\u2019s right. She\u2019s right; it annoys me.

I lurch with my world now and remember that I am still petrified slightly. \nBut for sure in both cases there was something more going on, some greater happening, and I can\u2019t remember it - I can\u2019t grasp it, it eludes me, I keep trying to get at it and it eludes me the thing that we did, the thing that we were supposed to do, and no matter how glamorous of great that thing was I am very much stuck here and faced before the fact of dealing that I do not know, that I do not have it.

I worry that this bed too will turn out to be an enemity, a rack or some other fancy BDSM thing that you sorta went to try it out but everyone there knows each other and you don't so no matter how interested you may or may not have been in the actual kinks it's too overwhelmingly awkarad to tell, such that i will cling to by choice and without pleasure for it, clinging to it because the alternative is more unpleasant for ceasing the status quo, that becomes more revolting, so you go on unjoyingly. The last stock-post-BDSM-thing i was in i clung to for that very reason, just to not lie alone and solitary in stagnant softnesss, soft against the exhausted unernest body, soft against the uninterested mind, and these things are unrelated. Will my lingerie eventually just entirely become a signifier or evoker of shame or guilt? Not some sort of protestant sex taboo guilt, but a more thiswordly one, one of embarrassment or escapism, a personally defined guilt, a custom-made guilt, guilt made by custom. It clings to me and holds my body, together. I make more typos.\n[day 3]",

You thought this thought biking up somewhere along l\u2019esplanade near the parcs of Parc, dark, leaves, light, shadows, and dismissed this thought for a moment because it seemed like one of those vain, essentially dogmatic adornemnts that come with the language or the ideology of whatever acutally effective tool you\u2019re going for (like, you take something effective - medicine, or witchcraft, or yoga, or poetry - and there\u2019s something to its essence, the actuality of the thing, the part that really does the work, and then usually there\u2019s the accompagning language, which is useful in its own right (see your second semester\u2019s thoughts on language, as well as what Rob told you about why Heiddigger translated into Steve Roggenbuck\u2019s lexicon or that of Teen Surf Goth would be a fascinating piece of art but a poor piece of philosophy), but is often filled with unncessary frills and cruft which distracts you from the core effectiveness of what you\u2019re doing, makes you more liable to burn out in frustration that it doesn\u2019t work well enough. So you abandoned it for a moment, the thought of familiar spirits, and noticed your euphamisim for your bipolor, your cyclothymia: Janus, a sort of two-faced thing, a macro from a few months ago (here, time is made very flat, so that all things happen sort of at the same time but not literally because you can\u2019t represent that at all, but this document is one of the few places where everything can sort of happen at the same time and still cohere. The other such places are, of course, the extremity of the hallucination, when you think so many things at quite the same time, and the conversation, where the interruption of the assosiated thought also deterritorilizes the whole thing, yet the fact of physically talking with anothe rperson grounds allows it to cohere in a consistency, the consistency being that you are the same two people with all of the assortedly said thoughts hanging between you and in each one\u2019s short-term memeory)\n[day 29]",

        "all the other miracles of the past day, of the past days of the past month dwindle in comparison, and let you tell me, there was helluvolot of miracles. You were as productive yesterday as you were in the past two weeks despite being heavily traumatized. You literally learned a very real essence of magic; butterflies are more similar to capitalis than you are to yourself a moment ago. And all of this means nothing, compared to this fact: you caught yourself. Manya, as you decide to call it after a passing cyrliic homophonia, was about to sacrifice your own self to live for a few hours more, like you did ever\nsingle\nother\ntime\nand now you caught him, did an actual truely miraculous witchcraft: got him to bed. you were literally manic for a moment, but you didn\u2019t overcommit, you prioritized care, you went to bed - on time! you didn\u2019t let yourself get distracted, you did all of the fucking self care you need to have that mania again today, hopefully, for a few hours, a sustability that means infinitel ymore than any of your current achievemnts. You\u2019ve had other interesing peaks in the past, but all of those were inherently phyrric. The notion of beign able to start win long-term is infinitely more, a higher cardinality. Even that time you healed yourself, when you were stricken to be hospitalized for six weeks and you healed yourself in a day or three and Laius told you insistently it was a miracle, even that in a certain sense doesn\u2019t mean as much as this sort of step towards \u2018sustainability\u2019, and the word is a sort of prostitute (like yourself), but this one is stripped of meaning by neoliberal nonsense, \u201cdirector of sustainability\u201d, etcetra. Here you mean something totally different, a signified that happens to overshadow its signifier, and here it is not our signifiers that drift polysemically, but the multifarious signified that needs a thousand signifiers, a structuralist take on Sepherioth. Think about the word, biowitch. Think about a thousand different words. Each of them has a tiny shred of where it\u2019s actually at, you know. This is the sustainability that is perversevence, you need to stop using the word sustainability here, it is becoming unstainable t b h, it\u2019s about an endurence or robustness or recalcitrance or even trust, trust in yourself, trust in a future (remember to trust your instincts; stop referring to the outside world, stop always checking your trip against what people say, stop looking for external markers of success and all; trust your insistincts, the world and the instincts are trying to teeach them, you have to pay very great attention for it all to work. reverse gaslighting.) Trust in the real possibility of a future that endures. This concept has something extremely powerful to it that you do need to reterroritolize or cohere into a word, such as that you be able to summon it in the past. Words and names both limit the \u201cpotential\u201d of a spirit (when spirits are fuzzy nameless mind idea things), but also give it potency of use, allow it to be invoked.

Well, not sure how priorities work - the previous moment had a great big thought about priorities, that the sense of enacting the absolute priority, the sort of absolute relation (like to art, or now the man with no face, or now god) to something in particular for a moment is an extremeist is an witchcraft is a miraclemaking. It needs a different name, but both the absolute priority and the partial knowledge hallucination control epeiphanies\u2019s invest-everything attitude is the smae and extremely powerful thing.\nThis doesn\u2019t go all that well with no sacrifices, but you can sort of have both at the same, just like you have everything at the same time. You have to go soon; this one is also a social obligation. But for another second, you do have to have both a witchcraft of no sacrifices and a miraclemaking of absolute maximalistic priorties. And I mean, no human sacrifices; you can\u2019t sacrfice people, can\u2019t sacrifice another. The problem is that you don\u2019t see yourself as a person, don\u2019t see yourself as an other.\n[day 30]",

The dream went something like this,a nd now you rehrease/re-hearse/rehearse it for the fourth itme: you are sitting in a restaurant with your friend, there is yogurt on the table, two packages,and somethmng else. You friend (Who at thi s point you realize must be Laius again, he infiltrator) tells you not to eat that yogurt, can\u2019t you see it\u2019s gone bad? But on previous iterations this either had not happened, or had happened differently, and in no case except trying to write this fucking thing down the seocnd time did you realize that your friend across the table was in fact Laius, out to get you in every shadow and thought.\r\nA revolution happens outside. You go outside. Yoiu no longer fucking remember the outside at all, besides dim dim DIM ideas of particular explosions, fire work like, embers and spinning and dark things and trees was it now you really don\u2019t remember but there is fascism everywhere you try to make your way back to a city a door a house inside somewhere but cannot, you are blocked, and now in the fourth iteration you remember that there was a a metro also and that the cops who called themselves revolutionaries formed parts of the defnsive lines but you waited for a while and pushed through them and ran and hid in bathroom after bathroom after bathroom and finally years later a stilnness reflecitng about your country (which may have somehow been india>?) and looking at your fae which has a tuft of hair at the throat and a long thin scraggedy mass of hair that assembles itself into a mustache. You think something about mustaches, the facial hair, the way individual hairs make themselves into a mustache, and do you are not dysphoric in this moment. You think of your country \r\nnd something about yogurt, soemtihng about this particular establishment. You realize this is the restaruarnt Laius took you too, and not a hint of yogurt in sight. but there was that thing . You amost fall into thte same trap and looose more of your work. Remeber now again, that there were two lines of people between the outside and inside, that some of them were definitely fuckers. Remebmertthat today after all is frickn election day, and there must surely be some sort of riots or something going on here..\r\nThe whole thing had happened between StHenri and Mile End, between Saint Henri metro and the mile end stores, or more likely the downtown ones, where the manifs happen, and the cops at the same time thought they were revolutionaries godknowswhy, all silly pants and things. And now I have to go out and be late, otherwise later I\u2019ll go out and be relally late, and that will ruin the set of this very important day.",

Let me make a detour here and elaborate for a moment that this is not just a confusion about pronouns, a sort of perculiar/particular/peculiar transness, but what is going on here is a confusion about subjectivity. Can you tell for certain where you end and I begin? Can I tell for certain where I cease and you start? Obviously this confusion might make for some ambiguity, but we can clear it right up: neither of us exist. The text exists; you don\u2019t; I don\u2019t. Accordingly, all this fuss we make over you vs me, the whole nasty subject-object relationship is but a bunch of bunk. A person masturbating, a person cutting themselves\u2015who is the object or subject of those acts? There is the action itself, and little else. Really and honestly, the whole fuss with the pronouns is only a tension between language-wide idiomatic conventions and the specific conventions of Post Aesthetics (RIP in pepperoni you flaming black wrinkley/wrinkly plastic bag of shit) on longform posts.\n[day 6]",

You\u2019re fussing around with it, so they (the mother? the connoisseur?) find someone else to hold their hand for them to leave the metro. Before that, on their way to the metro, the car you were riding in clearly caught fire from the lightbulb, and the three of you stared at it, or you stared at it, for a few seconds before trying to put it out with a water bottle before realizing that car fires didn\u2019t work that way, and somehow jumping out on the passageway. There is a hint of cop in the air, a play of flashing redblue over the un-filled-in scenery, but not really more than that.

Juptier makes fun of me for writing a book, says if he would write a book they\u2019d call it \u201cBOOUK\u201d.\nThe intensity of laffing at this sends me into a profoundly spiritual extended dream sequence. The Doctor Who theme song plays, a badly-edited panorama of four rainbows swirls before my eyes, and a vision takes hold of me. It\u2019s THEALLMIGHTYZEUS (TAMZ for short), and I can tell he shalt descend upon the earth, and this time it will be no swan nor bull nor golden shower, but a scathing blur of scrawny black and grey, whiskers and paws, striped eyes and tail. He has come to seduce me.\nI am already fainting, in raptures before this theophantic adavent. Melting into his knobby paws\u2015described by an article posted on THE VERGE as \u201cYOU SCRUBBLEMENT UP YOUR WITCH HANDS AND I DON\u2019T TRUST IT\u201d\u2015i am already beyond words, I remember my Giorgio Ambagan whose incomparable essay \u201cThe Idea of Communism\u201d aptly notes that \u2018in a sexual union with a god, the overwhelmed and happy mortal suddenly cancels the infinite distance separating him from the heavenly ones\u2019\u2015but in a flash he (THEALLMIGHTYZEUS) disappears from my embrace. Where has TAWS gone? The dream pans in glitchy slowmo. A  beige and chartreuse  streak speeds across the steps of Vatican City, overly scenic shots of ornate gold and marble in the background\u2026. there\u2019s the pope, with the funny fish hat and everything. Boom. Now he;s a fucking pile of blood, him and his patriarchal imperialist hegemony. \nSnazzy powerpoint fade-out. Now we\u2019re in Kent, south-east England. It\u2019s full of quaint ass houses and tiled roofs. Suddenly, every single trashcan starts vibrating in unison, and their resonance transports us into the past: 1770. beige and chartreuse  again, still accelerating, now across a gambling den, and there\u2019s the guy, bewigged as anything, goldtrimmed blue vestments, the goddang 4th Earl of Sandwich\u2015boom! guts everywhere, holy shit, the entire gambling community of 1770\u2019s britan is covered with guts.\nPowerpoint swirl transition. Still 1770, so we wait a few decades and go to Germany, where Georg Wlhelm Friedrich Hegel is about to develop the Other as a key philosophical concept for centuries to come, but no, wait, there\u2019s TAWS, and there\u2019s another fucking pile of blood. Flash forward into other scenes, and bang, bang, literally every theorist to ever use the idea of the other is maybe dead but defintely a screaming mound of intestines all over their respective floors. \nTHEALLMIGHTYZEUS, fur matted with blood, brings me these dumpstered glories. I swoon, and together we dine from the trashcan of ideology. \n\n\nADDENDUM: he had little hands, ok? belive me, i\u2019m a writier. and the trashcans weere really good too, they made lil tin sounds and shit. trust.\n[day 3]",

Nobody knows, but suddenly there\u2019s an aquarium, now there\u2019s rumbling sound effects faintly in the distance, splash! crash, crumble! This aquarium, by the way, is actually somehow made from human flesh and bone compressed into crystal. Despite this, the humans are still alive, and you can hear them grumbling and moaning\u2015at least, when that patch of pink inhabiting the aquarium turns away. When it\u2019s there, the aquarium is deathly silent. Another splashing sound. Who is it, anyway? Who is it? *suspense*\nIn retrospect, that scene was really confusing. Maybe it\u2019ll make more sense if we read further? Anyway.\nAnd there he is, just after the Beer Hall Putsch. I will have to make a rather uncertain, certainly contentious claim: hitler did not in fact do anything wrong. I say this as a jew with serious anarchist tendencies. The claim is based on the inevitablity, that fascists are no different from us, that if we seek to evade the microfascisms within us it is only through a chance of circumstances, an accident of the being that determines consciousness. Thus, hitler was trying his best, ya know? He thought he was doing a good thing. And a terrible thing: this one is a Hitler you can sympathize with, and you must recognize that there is a fascism in us all, a fascism in our heads and our everyday behaviour, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us (Mike Fukko, \u201cIntroduction to Anti-oeudsous\u201d). This is how that malevolently distracted blur, a beautiful little pink fish, sees Hitler. But the fish will kill Hitler regardless. I try of stereotypes about grouchy old Jewish man and excited ADD kids to post-ironically subvert while simultaneously making them sincerely fresh and interesting again in describing the fish, but draw a blank, dullminded as I am. Let me clarify that the fish uses they/them pronouns. They paint tasteless pornographic nudes of my ass with their cute little flipperflopper fins, and they will kill Hitler.\nOkay.\nHitler\u2019s dead now.\nOn some level, you do sympathize with him, you sick fucking bastard. Pink fish sharpens their knives, palette and flesh alike. Pink fish circles aquarium, now a pink sheen to the water. Will you be next?\n[day 4]",

There is a riverbank here, a river, an eddy. Across the street in the dark is a rough wooden fence, cyclopic, two rough people in front of. The cop shows up to investigate we shut something down. I no longer remember what. Obviously, the entire thing was a skit set up in case the cop would come, but it is still surprising we managed to hide whatever it was we were doing. The cop goes back and forth between the two of us and asks questions about our personalitiy profiles or so, our relations -- there is maybe two or three of us involved on the riverbank, and two of us near the fence, and we volley the cop between us as the headlights bore the through the raindrops.\r\nLater on, I tell someone I am good at containing things, I enjoy dealing with things, but she is incredulous - \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d my example involves shoes for some reason, and she quickly pokes a hole in my logic: what if you had 48 if them? it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re boots or high heels. I sigh and no, she\u2019s right. She\u2019s right; it annoys me. I think about the mist over the eddy in the riverbank that I am already forgetting, remember that the headlights bored through the mist and not the raindrops, wonder if there were any raindrops in the first place. I lurch with my world now and remember that I am still petrified slightly. \r\nBut for sure in both cases there was something more going on, some greater happening, and I can\u2019t remember it - I can\u2019t grasp it, it eludes me, I keep trying to get at it and it eludes me the thing that we did, the thing that we were supposed to do, and no matter how glamorous of great that thing was I am very much stuck here and faced before the fact of dealing that I do not know, that I do not have it. Normally I\u2019d go and go through that little infinite bookshelf of dark and light blues and whites with where all my friends become squares - they know they\u2019re talking to me, but today you reader compelled me and I shoved against my face the fact that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, I don\u2019t know what I did, and I have the faintest idea of what I will be doing.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible to try and get trazadone again. You need to stick to waking up a few hours earlier to entrain yourself. An automated  SAD/red lamp cycle would be ideal, but you can\u2019t get that any time soon. Maybe you try to use cannabutter again...\n      3. be hydrated - water bottle? this usually doesn\u2019t work, because you don\u2019t like those. Just remembering, prioritizing the intent to keep a glass of water close and keep sipping it. Be liberal and generous with your tea. MORE HOT TEA FUCKER. \n      4. eat better - soylent, free food, dad\u2026 You can try to figure out what the soylent servings actually are\u2026 apparently one cup of soylent and two cups of water is the right amount? The bag is only four meals, which is still a certain fair amount. Shop for perogi, lasagna, etc. \n      5. exercise - daily - first thing in the morning before meditating, and first thing coming into the house\n      6. medidate  - daily - likewise\n      7. keep taking vitamins\n      8. have a certain amount of hugs, but not too much. \n      9. prioritize sunlight. try bundling up and sitting outside during the few daylight hours.

TALK TO YOURSELF.\nthe mind and tongue and fingers and keyboard (physical organs each of the same level) do change with familiarity. you are not of this world (there was a moment while you trippin when you described a laura in this way and they collectively seemed to lash out at you, insisted you were hallucinating when really you were simply describing a banal thing about personalities and fashion. only shlomo listened, blessed their seemingly playacting heart). you are not of this world in that you have been away for a really long time and in this moment are also dissociated (writer\u2019s trance, brian calls it), that dissolution when you\u2019re working on something when you no longer exist at all not even as a bunch of other things like during ego death type experiences but here it\u2019s not even that, those other things that you might be don\u2019t exist either; only the world exists (and if you\u2019re tripping it can be all polymorpheos like those greek vaguely water deities - the old man of the sea, or Rhea, or Metis - and different in your place).\n[day 28]",

        "So the concept, the concept of living the life with that intensity where the life grabs you can and lives you with its own fullness - and again, this is a fact stronger and more sure than any measurement - well, for sure you can meditate and get fit and maybe perhaps the really strong at heart can sleep at the proper moments, but the life is possibly made out of living more than out of anything else, and the commitment to intensity can  (we all insist) be only heightened by chemicals, not created - the rest is all your own. Thence, the problem of ideology and planning, the problem of habits and structures.\nBut you (taking what we\u2019ve said there about the death of the subject literally, and trans\u2019ing our pronouns back, and out of respect for the ghost of Post Aesthetics, may that shithole RIP in pieces) mean it in a sense of the senses, in one of the senses, the great effusion was in the end a factor, a partial etiology of the lapse: you didn\u2019t sleep; you stayed there, up, unwilling to even so little as relinquish consciousness to dream, so much absorbed in the liveliness of the life, it holding you and not letting go. You wonder if there\u2019s a possibility to achieve the same intensity from scratch, from nowhere, just by focusing with the spiritual mind. You go and take my meds first, though.You\u2019ve gotten used to writing \u201cI\u201d, though, practically muscle memory by this point. The words of your roommates echo out and grip the room from the sides.\nWell, think of it. You know waking up at regular times is a sick way to guard your sleep cycles. What do you need. 9? 12/1AM-9AM is a legit as fuck sleep cycle, you could probably keep solidly to that. But then again you do sometimes occasionally have to wake up at 8, although now that you\u2019re here probably not much earlier than that. Yet definietly/definitely in no event except raves you don\u2019t and probably never will really end up going to will keep you up late enough for that to matter; the five ayy ems are all your own fault, you know this. You think, stupidely/stupidly, about polyphasic sleep again. You might try it, I guess, the wierdness/weirdness/wiredness of it does give a justification to the rigor of sleep, but then on the other side there\u2019s no way you could possibly spring for keto or whatever the fuck else is needed to sleep polyphasically.

Maybe that\u2019s a protagonist, maybe the falling-away of narrative concerns throughout our journy here wasn\u2019t quite a bad thing. Everyone was so concerned about narratives - Kousu kept talking about them, the podcast with bee-tamers about everyone who didn\u2019t believe in the story - sure, stories are important, and you can make life flow around them, but that word, \u201cnarrative\u201d, does impose a lot with it, and once you start talking with it you\u2019re so caught up in escaping or negating it that you forget to live or shape your own life, forget to take the chance to live it out, who knows. That one, just like you drew out in your little could-have-done-it-in-fivetene-minutes-but-spent-4-hours film, just like the teacher commented back at you recently, is also a narrative (techincally, though nobody ever thinks to mean that;the rule of the signifier has a sort of one-sidedness to it, sorry Cixous), this passage from concern with and rejection of narrative to an indifference towards and deprioritization of narrative. It goes with the graph magic you didn\u2019t think to write aobut it because it seemed like a boring math at the time. \nThen, between the mirage of futurity or its essays and the anxiety of conclusions, a real truth (different from that of Andres, \u201cdon\u2019t be so cynical\u201d \u201cof course you\u2019re an idealist!\u201d (another, more disappointing truth of drugs - hella fucked up coordination; feel sorry the man with no face\u2019s benoz withdrawls - no, sorry is not the word, is a this-worldly word; what you feel - no, not feel, further than that - what you - are? - is to remorse as weltschmerz is to irritation. how does a german philosophize, mr. sapir?), somehow he took three world-shattering events - well, no, not world-changing either - nothing at all has changed of the world, yet no part of this one has anything but a surface similarity to the world of last week (to write after autschitz is impossible\u201d, obviosly nothing to do with auschitz, but youare writing, are you not? what was meant?) and so three times: soul, death, art, each totally unexpected and essentially unrelated to the signifiying words (that is, the socially established connotation of those words, the socially-agreed signified of that is the most proximate to the one intended here, but hopelessly distant)\n[day 30]",

You friend (Who at thi s point you realize must be Laius again, he infiltrator) tells you not to eat that yogurt, can\u2019t you see it\u2019s gone bad? But on previous iterations this either had not happened, or had happened differently, and in no case except trying to write this fucking thing down the seocnd time did you realize that your friend across the table was in fact Laius, out to get you in every shadow and thought.\nA revolution happens outside. You go outside. Yoiu no longer fucking remember the outside at all, besides dim dim DIM ideas of particular explosions, fire work like, embers and spinning and dark things and trees was it now you really don\u2019t remember but there is fascism everywhere you try to make your way back to a city a door a house inside somewhere but cannot, you are blocked, and now in the fourth iteration you remember that there was a a metro also and that the cops who called themselves revolutionaries formed parts of the defnsive lines but you waited for a while and pushed through them and ran and hid in bathroom after bathroom after bathroom and finally years later a stilnness reflecitng about your country (which may have somehow been india>?) and looking at your fae which has a tuft of hair at the throat and a long thin scraggedy mass of hair that assembles itself into a mustache. You think something about mustaches, the facial hair, the way individual hairs make themselves into a mustache, and do you are not dysphoric in this moment. You think of your country \nnd something about yogurt, soemtihng about this particular establishment. You realize this is the restaruarnt Laius took you too, and not a hint of yogurt in sight. but there was that thing . You amost fall into thte same trap and looose more of your work. Remeber now again, that there were two lines of people between the outside and inside, that some of them were definitely fuckers. Remebmertthat today after all is frickn election day, and there must surely be some sort of riots or something going on here..\nThe whole thing had happened between StHenri and Mile End, between Saint Henri metro and the mile end stores, or more likely the downtown ones, where the manifs happen, and the cops at the same time thought they were revolutionaries godknowswhy, all silly pants and things.
