        my roommate kicks everyone out from the sex party, entrusting them with photos, paintings of different modes of complexity along their surfaces, sex toys of various denominations, and misbegotten socks. One leaves a painting with her, but she rests it on my parent’s kitchen table and disappears to make pasta out of LSD in frustration.

        She stands there near the door of the window, looking at the stove, and the steam covers her eyes, searing the glasses with bits of sky, but the air in between us attacks me. It’s cold. I’m not going to talk to her. She turns around, reaches inside the fridge, and as her body twists back towards me―
Her glance catches me, but I’m already a stone, and nobody minds.

        The thing is, I don’t have a roommate. In the future, my roommates will all be men, and I will bleed myself out at their convex nature, and then at my own insistent, pervasive essentialism (that men are convex). In the past, my roommates have all been subtle figures that certainly do not scream into my dreams -- only into poems and graffiti. They’re polite like that, well-behaved, having learned their manners and mannerisms in the greatest school on earth, no place in particular. We are only left to conclude that this roommate is perhaps a great circuitous demon, a mermaid (русалка) slipped from the mossy branches of my family tree/flowchart. Certainly she there does not resemble any other roommate, and soon I will destroy the roof of my mouth sucking the cracks in her construction.
        
        Regarding those different modes of painting, their is no longer a good and evil in this world, but a flatness which is also a depth and a complexity which is also a surface. It is not intuitive, but the geometric shapes tend themselves towards flatness, and the spontaneous length of time is an incomprehensible complexity, much like this one. Self-reflection is dizzying; my chest clenches up considering what the future might hold. I desist. 
        
        Her pasta was no better than stone soup, obviously. It seethed into the air, we peppered it with salt, it made no sense, it was a Jesuit miracle. The latter we knew intimately, as a rugged salt-n-pepper figure would shout every morning from the rooftops, silhouetted there against the shivering sun groaning pastels through mist: “I believe that Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish - but I don’t believe they were all satisfied,” over and over again as the crowds teemed their way to work.

        I worryingly ponder the pertinence of romans à clef in our day. Should I call him my father, or keep things simpler, and just use Laius? Kronos? Similarly the pertinence of Greek theater conventions. I would like to open this box from the inside; I would like to put the casino at stake and bet the house; I would like to infer that that nothing exists beyond the written word and in twisting my tongue long enough I will arrive at a world that is changed, and this is true in every sense of the word, although none the way I meant it. (and it was in fact made just so; not in the way you’d thought, but still exactly that)

I am transported to Fairmount and Esplanade, in a victorious burst. Behind this there is an entire an entire narrative arc, full of hopes and disappointments, but I shall not recreate it. I will not even recreate the joyousness of arriving, of home, of Mile End, of that other clichée stuff, this awkward cis roomierommie nor the weird-ass backwards swastikas on his art. The figure of Laius towers over this leap, this reterritorialization; together we sing that duet of turning over the chariot and building a pillow fort on it, sacking it, setting it on fire, signing the camp songs. Laius chastises me for considering campsongs as a form-of-life, tells me the Earth is Flat, there are twelve dimensions, the soul is infinite; and the echo of Ginsburg’s asylum mother says beat poetry sucks. In my other ear Claudius’ brother pours poison: there is neither subject nor fixed identity, only partial objects produced by encounters between machines. I tell Laius that there is a context, a vibe, a spirit to camp songs, and they and their artifacts are meaningless without getting into their spirit. He answers me softly, rips my bike off the roof. We embrace.

I am joyous. This world is full of light & texture; the frequencies of lampposts and beams, windows reflecting clouds, phones reflecting tree branches. What do they communicate. I am not writing a confessional novel, I am a dark & stormy night for sure, senseless with no single sensibility―but the librarian stares at me in curt tones (the retrospective recognizes both librarian and tone, but not the stare, nor this style here), so I give the book back. In a previous class, with a previous writing: “a conscious stream of piss,” certainly not consciousness. I aim for shitposts, though, but am at a loss how to execute these without brevity. Longitudinal shitposts. Certainly, body excretions are the very essence of my goals; isn’t the Kristevan abject a necessarily liberatory position (hearken towards the end - if only you’d listened and stuck to fart jokes!)

I am transported to Fairmount and Esplanade, the land of bagels and hipsters and jews. There has got to be at least a dozen books about the subject, but I have read none of them, and never lived in Mile End. I spent two months looking stupid, looking stupidly for a room, with a silence to my voice that signified swamp & stagnation & stupor. Do note: the grammar and punctuation is the essence of poetry, but I am writing a novel (you would have it). Who the fuck is going to read this? I am writing in the immortal genre of 4chan’s /lit/ board, I pay my homage to The Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Desert. I shut the fuck up and email my mother (the real one, not the one in the asylum).

The future is fucked up it has a very dark texture with grime along the ridges of the inside with the edges cutting the air up and the time negates itself and specifically the flesh in the throat at the base of the hollow of the throat explodes vibrating-dark red and the future in your eyes goes all fucked up and run away into three different depictions of panic attacks through separately recorded breathing tracks and precisely-timed cuts and message the beloved for kittens or their faces but they can’t send you their face because it was fucking eaten by wolves because they’re metal (who’d have guessed a moment without wifi would define the symbolism of a whole book?) like that so in the moment you keep vibrating without words for shoulders without words for anything without a trace of what feeling is really with just the sense of attacking the floor with your eyes of clutching for distance to disappear to create several layers of screens to suck off time-with-the-bright-future again literally the entire future is a kaleidoscope of fucked up but obviously the world rushes on and you (we’ve switched pronouns here, like the trans asses we are, except with subjectivities) can’t write anymore no matter how much you think about slowness and silence

Certainly there is a Light, not some sort of wonky divine thing but really on the edges and gradients of objects and trees and streets and windows and the entire world, the entire tiny world between two little frames, two by two little frames, four sets of eye lids or lashes, and we lash out at the world together in synchronicity, and stain this page black with cum.

Painting, you know, painting an intensity, painting being alive (painting on acid), doesn’t work -- i have no fucking clue how to paint. I say, “i will start measuring events, whether i should go a certain event, by asking: will i get more out of this than staying here and painting?” I can’t paint; i also can’t write: my shitposts at least are tightly edited, but this current nonsense here sprawls itself into length and I ignore the acutely intense finesse of sentence order and marks. But not knowing how to paint (not knowing how to live) you go up and paint an intensity, and how do you do it? You know about contrast, you set the oppositions up, you set the bright spontaneous burst against the structures darkly, and really all of the effort goes into the details of the structures. You snap out of it, out of time, into the world, and your therapist, who at this point is literally a beeping smartphone, tells you that time flies and sets scheduling the future, where we will have no electricity for ten days and ten nights, or maybe forty, but really it’s just next monday.

But the words really are a spectacle unto themselves, and I sit here on the wooden bench and my upper-crossed leg slowly goes dead, tingling, and the bench presses firmly against my ass, big spoon to my back, and my palms go mildly sweaty but not in the stereotypical nervous sense against the dirty whiteness of the laptop, and the text furls right out of me most of the time, in between pauses of forgetfulness, but then for a moment, after a moment, it’s there again, and by now I really have no idea where it comes from, just going, and largely i already have less idea where this is going than you do, because you have some certainty that this is drivel whereas I still have this misbegotten hope of getting better at it.

I stumble very awkwardlyakwardly against this new world where every thought is in times new roman and letters, with experiences laid out into words and a sort of hollowness of no longer having anything unsaid, and a sort of fullness with how much offers itself up, insistent, for the saying; and an intense fear of loss, of loosing, of lack-certainty, for certainly this novel will never be finished, not just a shitpost, not an elegant shitpost, but the kind of stupid one you type out and then a bit later ctrl-a backspace at how stupid and notworthit it’ll be. These days are filled with rapid oscillation and fear and brightnesses, all the highlights overexposed. Someday, will I stand on a stage with someone calling me multi-talented? Will I unfold like a swiss tool, my innards sticking out for varied utility, polymorphous efficiency?

I think to tap into the mood of this person on the stage with the lines of the curtains behind the stage and the little bright line of the microphone strange before their now-invisible face. Their tone voice vibe mood length-of-thought would stretch itself into my words if i was actually fucking listening. “steam rising from her mug of coffee” the stage says; it appears there is a person there, patches of light and shadows in beige and rose tones i know this. There is an entire world there, with a person. Would this person write an autobiography? Do they put capital letters in their books, this person? The people may or may not be thinking badly of me, certainly the cute greenhair person beside me, beside myself, smiled at me twice, and I have never had any idea what to make of it. I am not wearing makeup, and this skirt does not do anything for all its black androgyny. The reason I have no makeup on is a whole other story, and―
 the fact is that writing is a physical activity with a body inside of it, and this body is here and is distracted. Necessarily, to write with an entire body, to put everything on hold of the life and live a body into words. If I do persevere and write out the future, I wonder what my adjectives will look like, what they will look.

really though, when did i become such a millennial? when did this millennialism first penetrate my art? i very seriously blame Steve roggenbuck, Guillaume morissette (thanks for the callout, he said that semi-fateful-well-notreally night, and turned me into an essay; now there’s millennialism for you), and this person who signed their first email to me “dark haired girl with the soft voice”. ironically, she fled fb; invited me to where i met Guillaume and stole a scrap of stage to embarrass myself hypomanic forever (in my mind, anyway); invited me also to a decade or month of increasingly obscurantist correspondence which gradually dwindled to winnie-the-pooh pics and snail mail postits.

This document is going to be super evocative of a meme zeitgeist at some point, I hope. It was the best of memes. A grandmother holding two bananas captioned with a story about oral. Then just more of this thing I’m writing now, two mirrors reflecting each other, like in that one 4chan /lit/ post where someone pretends to be Pynchon or something: the old and new testament reflect one another, but not god, or something along those lines. Obviously, I am creating a religion, and it’s fervor and vividness corresponds exactly to the chemicals in the chinese room behind my flesh mask.

I really really honestly hope that’s how it works, really, (and it retrospect it does; this chapter and the next couple compare poorly to both yesterday and the end-blazing-part)). Hey, look, it’s like one of those a typical bedroom lamp and ceiling fan affairs, but―instead of the fan, it’s the lamp that spins!! a ponytail, held together by―that twisty bread bag wire thing!

dream:
Wow I am good at keeping things contained, I am glad to contain them, at dealing with people. There is a riverbank here, a river, an eddy. Across the street in the dark is a rough wooden fence, cyclopic, two rough people in front of. The cop shows up to investigate we shut something down. I no longer remember what. Obviously, the entire thing was a skit set up in case the cop would come, but it is still surprising we managed to hide whatever it was we were doing. The cop goes back and forth between the two of us and asks questions about our personalitiy profiles or so, our relations -- there is maybe two or three of us involved on the riverbank, and two of us near the fence, and we volley the cop between us as the headlights bore the through the raindrops.
Later on, I tell someone I am good at containing things, I enjoy dealing with things, but she is incredulous - “what do you mean by that?” my example involves shoes for some reason, and she quickly pokes a hole in my logic: what if you had 48 if them? it doesn’t matter if they’re boots or high heels. I sigh and no, she’s right. She’s right; it annoys me. I think about the mist over the eddy in the riverbank that I am already forgetting, remember that the headlights bored through the mist and not the raindrops, wonder if there were any raindrops in the first place. I lurch with my world now and remember that I am still petrified slightly. 
But for sure in both cases there was something more going on, some greater happening, and I can’t remember it - I can’t grasp it, it eludes me, I keep trying to get at it and it eludes me the thing that we did, the thing that we were supposed to do, and no matter how glamorous of great that thing was I am very much stuck here and faced before the fact of dealing that I do not know, that I do not have it. Normally I’d go and go through that little infinite bookshelf of dark and light blues and whites with where all my friends become squares - they know they’re talking to me, but today you reader compelled me and I shoved against my face the fact that I don’t know what I’m doing, I don’t know what I did, and I have the faintest idea of what I will be doing.

i am dreadfully worried that this bed too will turn out to be an enemy, a enmity. The light between these walls has a queerness that isn’t friendly, that doesn’t smile at me. It’s always evening here unless you turn a cutting light onto, a stripped light, a stripping light. I worry that this bed too will turn out to be an enemity, a rack or some other fancy BDSM thing that you sorta went to try it out but everyone there knows each other and you don't so no matter how interested you may or may not have been in the actual kinks it's too overwhelmingly awkarad to tell, such that i will cling to by choice and without pleasure for it, clinging to it because the alternative is more unpleasant for ceasing the status quo, that becomes more revolting, so you go on unjoyingly. The last stock-post-BDSM-thing i was in i clung to for that very reason, just to not lie alone and solitary in stagnant softnesss, soft against the exhausted unernest body, soft against the uninterested mind, and these things are unrelated. Will my lingerie eventually just entirely become a signifier or evoker of shame or guilt? Not some sort of protestant sex taboo guilt, but a more thiswordly one, one of embarrassment or escapism, a personally defined guilt, a custom-made guilt, guilt made by custom. It clings to me and holds my body, together. I make more typos.

“Can you help me decode a message from a hashtag boy”, says figure. “Call me Juptier”
We agree that Juptier should submit a bunch of drawings of anuses to hashtag boy. 
Juptier insists that he be referred to THEALLMIGHTYZEUS, yeah, mixing roman and latin traditions. Juptier makes fun of me for writing a book, says if he would write a book they’d call it “BOOUK”.
The intensity of laffing at this sends me into a profoundly spiritual extended dream sequence. The Doctor Who theme song plays, a badly-edited panorama of four rainbows swirls before my eyes, and a vision takes hold of me. It’s THEALLMIGHTYZEUS (TAMZ for short), and I can tell he shalt descend upon the earth, and this time it will be no swan nor bull nor golden shower, but a scathing blur of scrawny black and grey, whiskers and paws, striped eyes and tail. He has come to seduce me.
I am already fainting, in raptures before this theophantic adavent. Melting into his knobby paws―described by an article posted on THE VERGE as “YOU SCRUBBLEMENT UP YOUR WITCH HANDS AND I DON’T TRUST IT”―i am already beyond words, I remember my Giorgio Ambagan whose incomparable essay “The Idea of Communism” aptly notes that ‘in a sexual union with a god, the overwhelmed and happy mortal suddenly cancels the infinite distance separating him from the heavenly ones’―but in a flash he (THEALLMIGHTYZEUS) disappears from my embrace. Where has TAWS gone? The dream pans in glitchy slowmo. A  beige and chartreuse  streak speeds across the steps of Vatican City, overly scenic shots of ornate gold and marble in the background…. there’s the pope, with the funny fish hat and everything. Boom. Now he;s a fucking pile of blood, him and his patriarchal imperialist hegemony. 
Snazzy powerpoint fade-out. Now we’re in Kent, south-east England. It’s full of quaint ass houses and tiled roofs. Suddenly, every single trashcan starts vibrating in unison, and their resonance transports us into the past: 1770. beige and chartreuse  again, still accelerating, now across a gambling den, and there’s the guy, bewigged as anything, goldtrimmed blue vestments, the goddang 4th Earl of Sandwich―boom! guts everywhere, holy shit, the entire gambling community of 1770’s britan is covered with guts.
Powerpoint swirl transition. Still 1770, so we wait a few decades and go to Germany, where Georg Wlhelm Friedrich Hegel is about to develop the Other as a key philosophical concept for centuries to come, but no, wait, there’s TAWS, and there’s another fucking pile of blood. Flash forward into other scenes, and bang, bang, literally every theorist to ever use the idea of the other is maybe dead but defintely a screaming mound of intestines all over their respective floors. 
THEALLMIGHTYZEUS, fur matted with blood, brings me these dumpstered glories. I swoon, and together we dine from the trashcan of ideology. 


ADDENDUM: he had little hands, ok? belive me, i’m a writier. and the trashcans weere really good too, they made lil tin sounds and shit. trust.

Another drop falls, the music thunders now, another drop, another, a dank smell (haha Danke ye fuck off though i mean like sea mucus and shit you dumbass). 
A tiny ass snail slides out, and with a squelch sprouts ridiculously disproportionate tentacles, with some of them discomfortingly pixelated, No worries though, as the tentacles swoop in to grab our friend Joe in a choreographed frenzy, nothing lewd happens; they just pull him the fuck apart, salty wet blood and guts exploding in all directions, fuck, some of that blood is definitely fake there’s no way a single human is sprouting blood, holy shit, the entirety of the walls is covered in dense red, holy shit, was stalin some kind of alien fucker with compressed subcutanous reserves of blood? holy shi―
Another powerpoint transition, the music suddenly suspensefully soft. 1676. the same routine with the anticipatory tones, subtle signs of invasion, gastropods, mollusks, cephalopods, the whole deal, but it’s a bit less certain this time because i don’t actually know where we’re going with it this time. anyway, there’s the ancestor of Douglas Taylor (thank you for yr support <3), Richard Waldron, and there he is, foam rushing from under bloodshot eyes in a stunning archetypical display of nameless hideous faint foetid antediluvian antiquarian eldritch squamous madness.

Alright, it had to happen. We’re gonna kill hitler. Everyone goes for it, but we’re doing it it different. Where is it? What’s going on? Nobody knows, but suddenly there’s an aquarium, now there’s rumbling sound effects faintly in the distance, splash! crash, crumble! This aquarium, by the way, is actually somehow made from human flesh and bone compressed into crystal. Despite this, the humans are still alive, and you can hear them grumbling and moaning―at least, when that patch of pink inhabiting the aquarium turns away. When it’s there, the aquarium is deathly silent. Another splashing sound. Who is it, anyway? Who is it? *suspense*
In retrospect, that scene was really confusing. Maybe it’ll make more sense if we read further? Anyway.
And there he is, just after the Beer Hall Putsch. I will have to make a rather uncertain, certainly contentious claim: hitler did not in fact do anything wrong. I say this as a jew with serious anarchist tendencies. The claim is based on the inevitablity, that fascists are no different from us, that if we seek to evade the microfascisms within us it is only through a chance of circumstances, an accident of the being that determines consciousness. Thus, hitler was trying his best, ya know? He thought he was doing a good thing. And a terrible thing: this one is a Hitler you can sympathize with, and you must recognize that there is a fascism in us all, a fascism in our heads and our everyday behaviour, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us (Mike Fukko, “Introduction to Anti-oeudsous”). This is how that malevolently distracted blur, a beautiful little pink fish, sees Hitler. But the fish will kill Hitler regardless. I try of stereotypes about grouchy old Jewish man and excited ADD kids to post-ironically subvert while simultaneously making them sincerely fresh and interesting again in describing the fish, but draw a blank, dullminded as I am. Let me clarify that the fish uses they/them pronouns. They paint tasteless pornographic nudes of my ass with their cute little flipperflopper fins, and they will kill Hitler.
Okay.
Hitler’s dead now.
On some level, you do sympathize with him, you sick fucking bastard. Pink fish sharpens their knives, palette and flesh alike. Pink fish circles aquarium, now a pink sheen to the water. Will you be next?

The blushing fox goes to the market and wrecks shit, leaving flaming cops in her wake. The lil pink fish nods and paints the blushing fox. The blushing fox gets off four times in a row, bitterly bemoans the utter insignificance and irrelevance of french critical theory. The blushing fox does not get off to erotic media unless it’s old-ass erotic drawings and vintage porn; an aesthete in practice. You don’t know exactly where pink fish and blushing fox met each other. More on this later.

See the interesting thing is that working a lot, working all day, doing something with an intensity and a fervor - i mean, 10, 000 words in five days is cool, but it’s not everything  - ten well-researched essays in that time, that’s a different thing, but possible too, a certain intensity about time where the work feeds you, where (if you remember, through a  miracle of hpnogogy) the word fed you  for reals, overwhelmed and consumed, and now it really wasn’t an autobiography unless it was an autobiography of the text itself, with the vaguely human shape plodding at its margins.

So the concept, the concept of living the life with that intensity where the life grabs you can and lives you with its own fullness - and again, this is a fact stronger and more sure than any measurement - well, for sure you can meditate and get fit and maybe perhaps the really strong at heart can sleep at the proper moments, but the life is possibly made out of living more than out of anything else, and the commitment to intensity can  (we all insist) be only heightened by chemicals, not created - the rest is all your own. Thence, the problem of ideology and planning, the problem of habits and structures.
But you (taking what we’ve said there about the death of the subject literally, and trans’ing our pronouns back, and out of respect for the ghost of Post Aesthetics, may that shithole RIP in pieces) mean it in a sense of the senses, in one of the senses, the great effusion was in the end a factor, a partial etiology of the lapse: you didn’t sleep; you stayed there, up, unwilling to even so little as relinquish consciousness to dream, so much absorbed in the liveliness of the life, it holding you and not letting go. You wonder if there’s a possibility to achieve the same intensity from scratch, from nowhere, just by focusing with the spiritual mind. You go and take my meds first, though.You’ve gotten used to writing “I”, though, practically muscle memory by this point. The words of your roommates echo out and grip the room from the sides.
Well, think of it. You know waking up at regular times is a sick way to guard your sleep cycles. What do you need. 9? 12/1AM-9AM is a legit as fuck sleep cycle, you could probably keep solidly to that. But then again you do sometimes occasionally have to wake up at 8, although now that you’re here probably not much earlier than that. Yet definietly/definitely in no event except raves you don’t and probably never will really end up going to will keep you up late enough for that to matter; the five ayy ems are all your own fault, you know this. You think, stupidely/stupidly, about polyphasic sleep again. You might try it, I guess, the wierdness/weirdness/wiredness of it does give a justification to the rigor of sleep, but then on the other side there’s no way you could possibly spring for keto or whatever the fuck else is needed to sleep polyphasically. You might ask for reviews on facebook though (you never did, for some reason…).

There could have been an intensity, yesterday, yesterday when that silly multitude of “dream” sequences occurred themselves to you - but you got tired, you got exhausted. Sure on the one side it’s about sleep and exercise and that other shit but on the other side - you got yourself exhausted, you did it to yourself, and surely there could have been a mode and tenor of writing where that would not have been the case, where the giggles of the deal sustained you, no, sustained themselves till those same morning hours? And you’ve definitely seen it before, where the memes take hold of you and just about force you to keep making them, like in making the same one in different tones, that is just what had happened with the stories - so what had you not done? Was it a distraction? Was it an uncertainty? Editing alone can reveal. (You are editing now, still faced with the conundrum, now choosing to edit as a comforting reminder of some kind of glories past rather than gather a real list of cares that can be taken. You make your voice furtive, maybe through modesty or concern for readerly context jumbling, maybe through a sense of… nonpartisanship?, oweing your positive thoughts to another document, but this particular question from past you to current you is too direct to avoid answer… yet you don’t have an answer. You don’t know what to do to make life alive, don’t remember enough to tell if it was distraction or uncertainty.

There is a nonsensical brilliance in the way the light plays, the yellow harshness of the naked bulb falling across the room, imperceptibly--and the softly the rest of the greybluesky right there on the walls, and you could never tell it if not for the slight accent, the slight nuance, where the bluegrey announces that it is in fact morning and not some silent part of the night, not stripped bulb screaming all by itself, because you know that shade and those tones, and they too have a signature and a sign.

Dear Sir,


I hope this finds you well. Would you consider accepting a thirteen-thousand-word-long draft of the novel I'm working on in lieu of the essay―I feel as though it more adequately addresses the competencies of English 102 than the essay I did write―especially with regard to our class specifically, Portraits of the Mind. Moreover, you have surely had to read hundreds of essays on The Talented Mr. Ripley, whereas I am confident you have never read this novel. 


Cordially,
Em Liberman

dream:
Laius and raven give me advice in turns. I sit at the bedside of raven, or was it in the car of Laius, and hear about screens and their fragility. I go to bestbuy and look at rows and rows of external screens, but in the end the only screens and/are from credit card machines, miniscule - and besides, what’s the point of getting a screen for a laptop? One or the other councils me on another thing that happened, [in the a particular communal room at your college/in the office of the Reflections room], where a group of [busybodies took over it from an exam or a project, and these are highschoolers/highschool busybodies took over it for an exam or project], and I come up to one of them and switch the track to one No love deep web, and little kid walks away, although he’s a teenager. It seems unfair. Three out of four computers are gone now, and everything is empty, and these were the teachers’ computers, although, of course, the teachers used laptops, but the whole thing seems super unfair.
Crow definitely tells me stories and aphorisms, proverbs. He has gotten worse, unfortunately a deathbed, although towards the end of things I remember that he was to get better and fervently believe it. What happened? We talk about war and everything else, and he tells me yet another anecdote., but apparently I am too indifferent to remember the precise details, which is odd, because his anecdotes have on many occasions struck me to the core of a being, resonating. Hypnogogia is helluva drug. Laius is very frustrated that I did not understand what he was saying.

The great internetting said it would be something full of focus and clarity but the general impression of it was a noisy buzing/buzzing, appripriate/appropriate/appropos given the v particular way your body was made of bees. Let me make a detour here and elaborate for a moment that this is not just a confusion about pronouns, a sort of perculiar/particular/peculiar transness, but what is going on here is a confusion about subjectivity. Can you tell for certain where you end and I begin? Can I tell for certain where I cease and you start? Obviously this confusion might make for some ambiguity, but we can clear it right up: neither of us exist. The text exists; you don’t; I don’t. Accordingly, all this fuss we make over you vs me, the whole nasty subject-object relationship is but a bunch of bunk. A person masturbating, a person cutting themselves―who is the object or subject of those acts? There is the action itself, and little else. Really and honestly, the whole fuss with the pronouns is only a tension between language-wide idiomatic conventions and the specific conventions of Post Aesthetics (RIP in pepperoni you flaming black wrinkley/wrinkly plastic bag of shit) on longform posts.

You’re in a separate world with christmas lights and a pause. You no longer remember this, you loose coordination, but in your dream you distinctly post something to facebook about halloween, about halloween lights in scary colors being used to intriguing purposes, but the throught dries there because of a vague confusion about the world.

You insist, however, even without photoshop, it’s the painting in control, the painting that decides where you go, the painting that changes you, and certainly not you who decide or control the painting―certaintly adding photoshop to the mix doesn’t change that, doesn’t suddenly make you relinquish a control over the process, a control that you never had.

In this current moment this body is very soft, is pressed against and spooned masterfully by great threadbear, a bear made entirely out of plot threads. You don’t know why it’s so comfy; maybe the author is just compensating for this ridiculousness with the “plot”, aspiring to make it comfy. Whatever. Yesterday Guillaume Morissette says, “avoid the first person, me, I, mine. these are like pavlovian bells. this sinner does all the drugs.” You remember the great industrialist businessman from Burma who fills your nightmares by means of hourly lectures and meditations and literally a month total of silence now, that monk who clarifies that he is not a freak but a straight, not a guru but a simple teacher, glad to have been born to a business family, very lucky to have been born to a business family for it taught him the foolishness of money. You remember an anecdote he tells, of a real great learned bodhitsva who came to ask him for help in rescuing his elephant, his monastry, which were to be demolished. The businessman is confused because he owns neither elephant nor monastry. The businessmonk says, “but then i remembered that india is a land of wondrous contrasts, such wisdom--and such foolishness”. previously, you had always heard from your parents, “america - land of contrasts!”. the bodhitsva, this story was teaching us, was full of ego and attachment, gross attachment to these material possessions, but used “you” instead of “me”, “yours” instead of “mine”. But we enlightened ones, we sinners who have done all the drugs, know that language is a corporeal thing, full of idioms that don’t work if you change the pronouns in them, idioms that go on strike.

You remember now, what you copied “who loves in your throat but thick swollen language a new shape of semiotic rules”, but the meaning of this poetry-as-poetry, the language of poetry pretending that it’s making a poem, the meaning wasn’t there. The meaning was when they were talking about it, and the author of that looked at when you said you liked that line -- really the only reason you liked that line is because it’s the only line you heard, because the rest of the time you were distracted, and really you were totally keeping with your brand by spending 2/5ths of the time during that reading on your phone, literally shitposting, live -- the author looked at you and said it was about anxiety in your through clenching up, and you got it, you “fixed that sensation” (from the bit you had read that day), you fixed that sensation and it that moment nodding because you had both had a sensation you were certain was the same. Certaintly it wasn’t at all the same, was barely tangentially related, but the nod, the nodding between you -- that part was very shared, that part was real, alive.

You mumble. You wish you could get back to painting a face, you keep thinking about shadows. You spend a long time very distracted, looking at a simple bright white streetlamp shinig on the bricks. There’s the very bright bricks right next to the lamp, and the dim ones further away, (obviously totally dark ones outside the rays), but somewhere in the middle there is a peculiar middling shade that you don’t understand. The bricks are all slightly different colors, and the edges of the brick pattern somehow form diagonals in your mind. Nearby that, there’s the shillouette of a branch, but you’ve been seeing beautiful shilouettes of trees on brick and light on trees and leaves everywhere, and it starts to approach the status of sunsets. You wonder how to appreciate sunsets. You wonder about sincerity. You wonder about finding, either beauty or yourself, a ‘self’. You think about loosing a ‘self’, changing, immediately in flux. Obviously you strive to embrace change, almost tautologically, but also notice that change is its own death. You remember the old saying, about how evey moment that goes by is added to death, that death is the moments gradually past and not sometihng in the faraway future. You think about what else happens. You think about identity and transcience, sometihng about the context of the wisdom of beauty in transcience, repairing cracked pots with gold. 
You need to switch to a different track. This gets boring fast.

Your mouth dries up. Your tears fall slowly. You think piercingly. You run into Charles Mander and someone who can only be his partner by the holding of their hands, and Laius shakes Charles’ hand, and his partner’s hand, but you don’t, awkward. The awkwardness here is at the root of your misanthropy, that awkwardness about parting that has driven home the neccessity of never ever meeting someone again unless a life partner, but then building a life is not somethign that makes sense either. Laius becomes friendly, painted-over with a thin thin layer of red and white. You start to get the vaguest sense of how to mix colors, tempered by a terrible impatience. You look at your portrait of the man whose face was eaten by wolves. It looks okay from afar, though you do keep getting really miffled about the nose, but you eventually start to notice that the shadows fall in ways that make some sort of sense, that the shapes stand themselves out. Your sense of terrible impatience is tempered, in turn, by a total inability to squeeze paint in the amounts you mean, the paint falls out the tube like vomit and diarhea, incontinent, and you so hate to waste it, you need to make something, but nothing is at all the way you want it, everything, always, is Too Much, so much the time too much going away, worryingly, Too Much. You wonder what drugs to do tomorrow, wonder blankly minding your own and other’s business. Your dad, the vague shape of Laius drifting across him but slowly becoming unfixed, the key turning the roman a clef into Guillaume Morissette's indictment of a personal essay, a creative non-ficton the all the other authors condemn you too, your dad asks you to find a product on Etsy that a client asked him to buy for her, the client. You mind other people’s business, hoping that the distractions of this do turn “Portrait of the ADHD artist in shitposts”, or whatever that guy who keeps making kinda stupid kinda vaguely irritiating comments on your posts but you keep him around dispite not liking it very much because sometimes they are very validating, what did he say that portrait was? Anyway, we get it, you’re very easily distracted and you’re oh-so-clever in conveying this distraction to us instead of doing it the other way round and having the text sort and iron out your thoughts, the thoughts force the text and the syntax and the whole blessed thing into a perversion made partially bearable by memes, like utterly gros synthetic matter taking on the appearance of a food through the clever application of food coloring and the like. We’re very cheerful about ourselves today, enjoying all the praise that’s been heaped upon you.

You notice, in fact, that your constant self-abasement, which was formed not even so much out of depression but out of a way to give the world meaning, to insist that if bad things happen then it’s your fault so that at least it’s someone’s fault, it’s something that can be changed and fixed rather than some absolute and cruel eddy of that “an indifferent and uncaring universe”. Hence, self-efface and self-depricate, but also everywhere draw attention to yourself and show off, because dang, effacement sux, doesn’t it. But depression too, definitely. So you say that you aren’t the best at memes either, that you don’t have the dankest content, because there must be people better than you. You dismiss compliments on content as jokes, misconceptions. You fume. But obviously, in between the different ways of being, when in any crowd, you’re noticably the most meme-savy, really quite often (but not always, I guess).

This is both proper and improper; the words are their own thing, casting the people aside, and you are a person, and you see them rarely, never, really. You worry your worries away and wonder and mumble in fear and terrified anxiety. Who was this love about? Was it you or them who wrote it? It’s not even a love poem, both you and everyone who would write anything like a love poem have just enough taste to avoid that, so all of them are like, like―you find the expression in an anachronism, feel slightly guilty about using your metaphor du jour about the feelings of the past, feel obligated to pay repsects to nostalgia in own, proper metaphors, a sort of temporal adultery―

My initial motivation for this is a desire to read Deleuze, to read all the theory, and a frustrated at its inaccessibility. In general, books and essays seem to tend towards linearity, contextual isolation/segregation, de facto burying themselves with prerequisites. I want to fragment these texts, make it immediate, non-linear, concise, easily re-contextualizable, social, promiscuous, rhizomatic.
I have no single vision for implementing this, and greatly want to hear people's ideas.
One way for implementing this is to have embodied readings or projects that leave traces or notes matching these criteria.
Another, probably too restrictive and problematic vision of this is a hypertext of fragments, where a given text becomes fragments linked:
- sequentially, going from one sentence to the next, or the previous
- topically, going from a fragment to other fragments on the same ideas. One way to partially implement this automatically is by reverse-indexing the text, linking each page to other pages under the same index heading. I have a really shoddily-done mockup of this at https://glycan.github.io/kplat.html
- by level of detail: paragraphs, sections, chapters, texts concisely represented (e.g. summarized or abridged) as fragments (i.e. each group of fragments has a single, more accessible fragment summarizing it). This goes from least detailed (the summary of an entire text) to most detailed (gloss, commentary, and references for individual sentences). It seems like this would allow a reader to nigh-immediately seize the most relevant parts, making it possible to connect them with other ones from totally different disciplines without the barrier to entry of the discipline's groundwork.
(Through these fragments, the entirety of each text can be accessed)

 Wishing and pants, teaching. Dreams aren’t appreciated unless concise, and I am self-consciously performative now, instead of selflessly performative-- at least you are. It hiccups inside of you and vanishes into the distance. You think about dream recall. you wonder what to do. There are six or seven different dreams after your roommate woke you up rapturously, but none of those mattered all that much reall

dream:
You are riding in the metro, discussing chocolate with a connoisseur. There are your mothers, one great and one normal, both step, one frail and one normal, both going to vote or some such. There is a vague sense of sexuality; clearly this was a sex dream before this. You note that the connoisseur is from Tapir. Is that a mountain? She explains that your choices of chocolate reflect who you are; people are usually guilty about dark orange chocolate, at least for a while. You also have milk chocolate on you. You’re fussing around with it, so they (the mother? the connoisseur?) find someone else to hold their hand for them to leave the metro. Before that, on their way to the metro, the car you were riding in clearly caught fire from the lightbulb, and the three of you stared at it, or you stared at it, for a few seconds before trying to put it out with a water bottle before realizing that car fires didn’t work that way, and somehow jumping out on the passageway. There is a hint of cop in the air, a play of flashing redblue over the un-filled-in scenery, but not really more than that. Part of the porn you were watching has definitely invaded your dreams; you had sex with a stranger, but do not remember it at all, on your way to vote. Tapir…

Montreal / Boston / Serbia / Austria / Greece / WTF / where do you live / what do you do / what have you done? What have you done? What are you trying to do with your life? You regert at not having done more here. Are you leaving? are you leaving soon? why do you regret? you can keep doing things when you leave; is it that you wanted to have already done more things for when you are in a different place or is it that you wanted to to do more with the people here? Is it the anarchists, the poets, who is it? The trans lesbian family? What is it you are trying to do in the other place?

 You have no idea what you’re doing and are blinded by,it, possesed with a certainty that you’re doing something wrong, something horrible; that you are way too smol for the future and it seems so cute now but the future is definitely going to consume you totally; that this is clearly written in the current terror or shame of not having done enough; and at the same time a certainty that you could not have really done anything else; what else was there to do? what else was there to do? and again the whole thing of what could you have done, a terror, and in moments also a great anxiety and a great sadness at the other moments where you were a sloberring hulk of a trace of a being with nothing more to you and those very figrues you hoped to become were alientaed.

 fumbling for form; each form, was a fear. not a bike or a box or a passerby but a vague object and an emotion, and a precariousness, tumbling, alarming. there is something about the way things happen that alarms. you take an arction, you make the gesture of the spraypaint or sign the document or say the words or type the letter, and now your life is a different life, but there is no fanfare except your surprise at there being no fanfare. it is a delirious vertigo.

Yesterday there was something of a revelation. The essence of it gets a bit foggy, but it’s sort of like a partial intoxication, where the acute clear part of the mind is slowed, but the background of the mind is not changed, and a sort of libermanness, a libermanly Familiengeist…. and a bitter pessimisitic realism, how Laius has it - “I’m not a pessismist, just a well-informed realist”: if you spend the rest of your life like this depressed with little bits of mania that never go together?” -- it it a wager you can bear to loose? yeah, you think you might somehow get yourself to stay somewhat up forever, but that’s just a hope, a vain hope, and maybe it might happen but probably not. So-- if you can’t deal with that, do you go into it? if there’s a risk you cannot bear, of this loop of insistently naive hope followed by can’t-think-crushing-depression? 
is it ever worthwhile to venture into a risk you can not bear to loose, an outcome you would not survive?

there was a full and real dream this time, you hovered at the edge of it. in the dream… no, it doesn’t quite come, it’s too late now. something about a party? it doesn't matter anymore. you balance bitter pettiness and a going-with-the-world-ness. this does not help very much. you despair at your dirt, the odor of your everything. you wear all black, which is literally the exact outfit you wore yesterday, but this time it’s a conscious decision. however, if you hadn’t taken this decision, you would have worn much the same, because there isn’t much else to wear, you know. You go to the bathroom, see if the hot water works now. It doesn’t. You come back. your room feels much like you do, homophrosyne, a mess, disgusting, bearing an effort to fix things that lasts all of nothing before giving up. It goes this way. 
%split%
you read a poem by alex manly, that you heard yesterday, at the cafe that made such a big impression on the first day writing, the bench spooning your ass and all. you asked everyone about sleep there, asked about sleep and tried to pretend you were still related to the same person who’d made a favourable impression when you were hypomanic (but you aren’t related: for sure, you are not the same person, you are not a person at all). the poem is beautiful. the poem doesn’t say very much to you except it's intense, vivid beauty, made the more intense by the fluidity and the choppiness of the style, what your early work wishes it was, and the distinct post-internet thematic of it, which your current work does (but nothing else). there is a distinct aura about the lines, the line breaks, the little choice of words; this is someone who knows what words taste like, a taste you cannot remember today, but now you remember you want to. yesterday, alex appreciated your attention to what he read, despite your distraction, appreciated the way you said it, and that is the kind of appreciation that ‘makes the world a better place’. it was a good, fantastic reading, but you have to fault them for your depression. it really lacked a punch for it.

so now, you get up and wrestle with bitterness, try not to get up, try to get up differently, try to ignore or bettile somehow, try to ruin something for someone-who-is-to-blame, try to at least get food, eat something, because fuck. ―and then― and it’s there, it’s really exactly there, the whole thing, and now you just need to get over there and read, read the entire thing, read all of the other things everyone brought up to you yesterday, because it’s there, a delayed effect, but it’s there, just what you went there for, the vim and vivacity of people who are well invested in what they are doing, and this is not a financial investment but an existential one, a venture, a venture that puts at stake one’s very existence, just like nick land wanted, and these people are doing it, so you have to do it too, not even for the words themselves but the spirit behind the words, this is not a platonic ideal, this is a real emanant thing, it bites your ass and sends you. so go on, 
        get on with your life

tiredness isn’t a word; it doesn’t deserve to be a word; it never was a word at all. it’s, like, a discourse, sort of like what you’ve made of the whole six word story thing: it’s not a gimmick, it’s a genre, a mode―documentary six word stories, six word horrors, six word mysteries, etc, etc. tiredness goes another scope beyond that, a precondition for existing, for this way of existing, like a law of thermodynamics. you can come up with speculative science fiction where it’s not true, but in this world the most you can do is simply accept it, and recognize it only sometimes, like how the shadow of steam rising on the wall betrays betrays something about heat, how a leaf falling betrays something of gravity and fluid dynamics, something to be remarked but never otherwise noticed, how meditating betrays the invisibility of breath. likewise this.
%split%

nor is the library quite a bustle. you describe everything, now, in dull tones; if you were painting, you wouldn’t change the water in your brushes; you wouldn’t quite rinse your brushes. you use dull words. this makes sense. the spectre of Laius hangs over your art, calling it depressed, going back uncertainty and preferring the words ‘major’ and ‘minor’, but really just talking about the prevailing intensity, value, vibrance, etc of the work, and he makes a father figure in his image, you make such a figure to watch over you and call out your art. so this is what, a taboo?
the library is not a bustle; bustles do not exist either. you walk there and there are many people doing separate things, there is a waiting, the permanent moment of collision and subsequent flattening of your face, your entire self, the self you do not have. everyone is a bit desperate; presumably everyone hurries, but everyone is desperate. things don’t work and you wait, you wait and see someone’s computer, the flashes of what everyone does obligation, and this one is on hypomania vs mania. you keep catching yourself about that, and here someone clarifies it. oh well?

nothing was alive. everything is withdrawn ito itself yet accessible for it. everything take on, maybe, a transparent flatness, revealing its innards and effacing them into a plane. There dreams, for sure (although you’re starting to get a bit discontended with the witch brew nonsense), there were dreams, but you didn’t help any of them. There was a thought, like, what’s the point in staying up awake to experience cognitive distortion when you have the same thing so much more fun at sleep? There was, also, that also very party-like sensation of everything going wrong butin an enjoyable sort of way, a worthwhile kind of thing. It does confuse you, but you don’t get it.

It goes: dark, scribles, red and orange and black marks with circles in barely visible under the darkness. Each circle streams from left to right, drips from left to right one after the other. On the right side, between the lines formed by the dark red and orange drips, it goes: yellow-green, blue, green-yellow-orange, yellow-orange-pink with scribbles pink with scribbles, then down to mauve and blue. There are sparse orange diagonals, bottom left to top right, from the darkness out, and some of the lines of bright smooth colors are caught in the cross sections of the diagonals and the dark drips.
you are agitated about this art, agitated and focused, you are pretty fucking nauseous. you are witnessing yourself, what? one moment up, one moment up, one moment down, sobered, but not sobered, just―splattered. there’s the familiar pain-heaviness in your chest, and the one in the stomach pit also, and now the excitement of the piece in its brilliance is gone. In the top part, the blue bleeds into the yellow on both sides, a beautiful gradient bleeding tree of a color. Lower, the purple explodes into the pink, a orthogonal flower. everything is scribbles under gradient.

the painting doesn’t say anything, but all of a sudden you remember that writing is a physicality with a physical rhythm and a physical body inside of it. you’re not sure if this really helps or not. 
the painting answers thusly:
each moment, each set of moments, is several things. there is the texture of the moment, the ridges and haptic world that the sensations or ideas write themselves across. then there is the raw scribbling or the world, designed. then there is the dissolution, the analysis, the abstraction from the scribbling of the world into a watercolor of gradient. then there is the accidents and fantasticalness of the dissolution, the bleeding. 
then you look at this and feel and remember your heaviness, and now the time is up.

Finally, there’s an image about time and duration: if you turned away from the world completely and stayed to be a hermit in your mind, did drugs for the rest of your life, the trip would be less good. you have to stay in the life, both in the social life and in the material project life, but you can’t let yourself be consumed by either of those things, because you need to keep yourself to yourself. This is the same thing about the duration of microdosing, microdosing goes hand in hand with the heroic doses. The duration changes everything―in the same way that the ground, the world, the setting changes everything. You write a poem, it shows a little bit of you, you write a novel, it shows you variedly; you’re maniac for a day, it’s dissappoint, a week is this long a project and no longer, a month--who knows? likewise the ground and the world you turn away from.

The girl with a face is not in fact a particularly good trippsitter, as it turns out, and you were slightly deiceved. You should have, clearly, listened at that earlier point in time yesterday whene verything was still kinda different or maybe okay or I don’t know what, one of those moments when you had dipped out of the stream to pick this one up, to pick up yourself, and you had wondered for a moment that maybe if you were fully tripping you sahould just stay, safely, at home, and not invite peopel into your mind-house, your house and everything else literally and not figuretively being part of your mind unheimlich because that’s how it, but you didn’t listen. if you prioritize this thing of sleep and writing strongly enough, will you listen in the future?
but right now in this moment, you are immensely dissappointed, because it is 1pm and you just woke up, and the voice from the past―you were re-christenianed “Memnosyne” on one of the birthdays, soemone drew you a profiel picture, baptisim by #00000FF, tells you you will have a week of depression for your troubles, and you dispair: how will you write? how will you keep the man with no face alive?
BUt maybe you are a witch. maybe you are a witch, maybe you can go back into time, go into a different timeline dimension, doublethink your imagination―yesterday you both teleported into another dimension for actual and real and covered up your tracks with doublethink―or even some kind of witche’s brew appropriating the pharamaceutical, the pharmakon, which you have to go and learn more about nd make the upcoming week something worth doing.
then there was the part about your dad, how each relationship was actually the same relationship, both with overcommitment, and with fights, and with people not taking care of you
then there’s the part about the intense non-linearity of this world, what this world does to you, what this world does to your mind. it is neither movie nor book, but some kind of cubist painting, the entire world, all at the same time, going in all the different directions. you cannot possibly think one thought without thinking every single imaginable thought at the same time; it takes you so much fucking effort to write or say one thing at a time, and even then your marginalia explodes, overflowing, bursting, bustling, blowing over, over and out.

then there’s yet another part, about the truth of drugs: drugs do nothing. drugs are not a realy entity, they create nothing, they don’t change who you are. at least, these drugs, you still have enough humility in your psychosis to know that you can’t speak for everything but only forr that which you have yoursefl already experienced, so you have to stick with it all the fucking way and cannot ever give up anything ever.  these drugs do nothing but reveal more sides of you.

You also know that you will definitely not be able to publish this passage, wonder why if you’re doing this for purely therapeutic reasons, wonder why you bother to render eva as the man with no face etc…. but this was always a totally private document, only to be excerpted, never seen whole, an originatory mythos much like the Necronomicon, from which only short stories can be drawn about its refelction.

So you have to take care. Figuring it out yourself, calming down and taking care, is the most valuable thing you can learn here, and i (we’ve reached another transness now, a totally dissassosiated split personality; the discourse and intercoruse between you and i i and you is not merely a linguistic one now, not merely a matter of forgetting within one idiom and remembering within the next, but an actual change of person in the “author”, the auxiliary of this text, who has been utterly deformed for the writing of it…. when the cyborg metalsmith runs out of metal, the cyborg melts itself. For this reason there is both an interlocutionary I, the “doctor witch mom”, the caretaker, and you, who are mucking around the life for no good reason) do think that if you deal with it well enough it will work out that way. Take care; this is an important skill. If you learn it well, anything that goes badly here will have been worth it, will of have been a positive experience, will be easy to render and rehearse as a positive experience in your memory.

For a moment, however, you get distracted, write down the next bit of the future in the future to give you a moment, singular and unexpecte, in the present (“an anthology of moments”, you remember the subtitle, and are once again gone from the current moment you are experiencing), the current moment with your ass, both frozen from the cold outside and overheated from still being bundeld up inside, against the hard, practically highschool firmness chair in cafe replica, but this is not what has attracted you to this moment in the present, enither that nor your fucking freezing toes when are you gonna get some thermal socks you dumbass. What attracts you is the fog on the windows, the huge windows utterly fogged over, with drops going down them and tracing lines. this could have been a painting for anything: the light florescent behind them casts gradients indistinguishable from underepainting, the windowframe makes it a formal composition if desired, but the actual line of dense fog, less dense fog, and rivulets of dripdown water are all irregular, forming something like mountain peaks. In the other window, bisected by the line hanging from the windowshade, the fog forms a sort of half-triangle, all lines at the bottom at the apparently freying edge, the fog fraying to reveal the november tree tickle shiver vibrating from the invisibly small snow (or is it your myopic vision?).

if you had some way of indefinitely modifying serotonin homeostasis, could you trip indefinitely? a cyborg or transhumanist future appeals quite a lot, really. cyberpunk magic or sorcerorpunk or whatever is pretty likely. in a society where everyone might be hallucinating all the time, why wouldn’t magic (the real one, performance art, I know, you must have said this forty times) be ubiquitous? You think you spelled “ubiquitous” right the first try, you think about how a novel works, one of those fabulous authors like Atwood or Nabokov who even when saying something you don’t really care about that much ooze their language all over the page, it gets in your eyes all their words which, elsewhere, are a sign of trying too hard to be pretentious but for them those words sing and dance properly, them twenty dollar words from kindergarten or whatever. What is it like to write five hours a day? (After the fact, you know: weird as fuck. You entire sense of writing is totally changed). There’s no real reason for you not to know. The society where everyone has tech-mediated homeostasis (this resurfaces a thought about implants and another about memory), not to mention the imminent possibility of google glass or oculus rift or whatever mediating reality itself - that’s one hell of a setting for your set - , would be a strange one indeed. The plane crossing the sky is familiar to you, but carries the idea of unfamiliar, a previous unfamiliar to someone else. What would it be like to first see birds? You neither really know Baudrillard nor Luddite (or whatever anarchoprimitivism du jour actually has some sort of currency in your circles. All the hyperreal nonsense from all the lovely folks over at the Philosopher's Meme… you keep meaning to catch up with them. How? When? Will you make something out of your future, with 820Plaza and Deleuze and TPM and the internet and everything, or just lie in bed for 10000 years, but these ones will be un time diluted, real hours and days, made possible by the wondrous technology expanding our lives into nothing at all. You are not a futurist, are you? You keep confusing your tense, occasionally going back and correcting, occasionally deleting passages and rewriting something else.

Wait, change the music; it defintes the tone of this writing. Early Red Hot Chilli Peppers, while nice, is not good. Deftones was better, but still distracting. You’ve always been confounded by music refernces in the post-internet or alt lit scene; you were raised with a bitter prejudice towards “boogie woogie” (a genre that, for your parents, encompassed both EDM, pop, reggie, and actually literally everything from the anglosphere; the only thing worth listenign to is our own russian bards, author’s song, which you did remain fond off and even translated a few to his great pleasure, and transling this does seem like something vaguely accomplished. Maybe you have done something or other with your life. The insecurities loom with your ramble. You never did anything with that translation. Now Spotify, who is not a shaman, performs Bodies by Drowning Pool for you. A day or two ago you read a poem by Alex Manly, “Bad Reputation”, after a song you did not know to a person as it turns out you don’t understand at all, in spite of this being the closest person you have right now with the possible exception of Laius, and yet you have no fucking clue whatsoever what in the world to say to them. “I just wanted you to be there for me”, the man with no face said. You didn’t know what to say; you said the wrong thing, and then they killed themselves over and over . “Breaking up is the closest I can get to actually commititng suicide”, the man with no face says. You’re just warming up with this freewriting nonsense, getting back into gear, finding how the words align themsleves, because you actually do know how to write. Is your poetry blog at 500 posts now? You 13 year old. “you’re a flower, the earth and the sky, I couldn’t imagine a universeve or galaxy without you. I hope you find soemone who makes you infinitely happy” the man with no face tells you. You, a literaly shitstain, start saying something about how that’s not how that works, how tripping showed you something about that that that’s not how that works, that you just sort of have to deal with misery and suffering and do the best you can and keep going because the certaintly of faking it is what does both placebo magic and powerful performance art, powerful art in general, poesis, making (how could you have forgotten about the verb poesis during that bender when you didn’t forget it while during all the various ordeals of medidating? “Would you go to Vipassana”, you ask  for some reason between her sobs. You are flat on your back, immobile, neceassrily silent. Cat got your tounge? Portrait of an allergy sufferer (final)). “I might die. You could appreciate me a lil.

Writing about this is difficult. You’ve broken off talking twice, four times, every single time in the past two days. You keep wanting to get back - what about the other cute things, what about your body, what about the partiuclar effects of this ritalin trip which is its own thing of adenosie excesse or whatever causes you to feel like shit for a week after fucking circadean rythms but with aboveaverage dopamine, what about the light, what about the wierd idea with the implant to control your mind, what about transcibing all the chat logs and facebook posts? You’ll never get to any those if you’ve put it off for a good four days or a week like this. You don’t know how long it’s been. You really want to avoid writing about the root of the problem, because then all the death and god inside of you will bubble up. What Shlomo never told you was that god existed inside your solar plexus, was the burden you hebrew struggled with all along. Hela Trol Pis AKA Valerie Solanas (but not the other val you’ve had a crush on forever who even this month made you freak out as Adam Zachery swung the length of her brown hair―their; Adam, unlike Val who possesses their image for you, uses they/them pronouns. You say: “now those are some eyebrows that proclaim, “they/them” to a…. hookup,? a crush? There was the whole Alex/Cherub thing from when you were tripping, but you don’t have the time to write about all that, not even in  the 20000 words you have left, unless you just meaninglessly skim the surface of what you’re talking about. Deleuze and Guittari talk about the feeling of writing in an interview or something, but nobody reads, nobody reads this either. You’re forgetting to eat, you don’t want to eat, this is the food -- s / o to Nulifar b t w - this is the food you poison your depressions with, when you were in the great mansion of a house last may and ate Nulifar alone until you hated it.

You think back about the idea of going with the partial thing. You can never ever know everything (just like with god, Shlomo) or have a perfect solution or really you can’t do anything right ever - but you still have to keep trying, still keep going with the partial, operate with ewhatever mess you have, and the confidence of the motion or the going along keeps you there. Is being an adult - you think even further back (plus-que-parfait) to a long conversation you had with a professor in the middle of a hallway as the crowd streams around you - is being an adult consist of getting over things? Yet you cling to a sort of juvenile romanticism “youthful maximalism” as laius calls it where the end of history the destruction of the universe in a word the absolute is a real thing, idealism is not something to give up on just because your brother turned twenty and you will eventually, if somewhat uncreatively, do the same thing.

But actually the thing about partials is this: when you’re so stoned you can’t finish thinking a thought without forgetting it, to do anything, to take care of anything, you have to throw yourself into whatever faint notion you had while still groggy because if you try to figure it out fully you’ll absolutely forget and get sidetracked entirely, but if yoiu’re doing something with your body, if you write your intent however partial into an action, it will stay there and remind you and develop into something else, and the partial action faint notion of an idea as you start doing it without knowing what you are doing,more information will come to you and you will know what to do, will gather your throughts and move towards a mindset around that action where that action, as full of an action as you can get in this wretched world, will be possible (and proabbly only that action becase you’re so stoned). This is how it was, and this interesting as it is imporatnt.

Time seems very bizarre. You try to do the math, figure out when you’re peaking and crashing, but nothing makes sense. You figure that you took phenibut at around 10:30, so it started around 1pm and starts peaking around 6 or so. Ritalin was… 1, so first peak is 3-4 (more on this later), valley around 5 (is it about half an hour on each side?) and the second peak must 7-8? that would be right after therapy, therapy being a whole nother immense painful thought. There is an immensity of sky, entirely full of different tones. You seem to have lost familiarity with everything while you were tripping: now the same old tree branch silhouettes against the sky (did you miss the sunset again, or was it simply canceled? you definitely missed the sunbathing you were going to do). Your palms are sweaty against the white plastic of the laptop now, heavily so. The trees sprout from the college, both shillouettes. You fix it with the camera, and there are spots of explosions over it you didn’t see with your own eyes (the streetlamps, comparatively invisible to humans. We never did finish up the transhumanist segment, did we). You even eventually get the focus right, catch a car speeding by as a blurr that you didn’t see in real life either. The texture of a cloud looms up way too close, invading your personal space, the texture cropped (truncated? you search for the word for a minute) by another building, the one that’s all mirrors (and the mirrors are little slits of cloud, too). You go to try to get food in a place full of panic at everyone who looks like an adult (you were arrested here two years ago, and banned, but they don’t know shit except for the manager who yelled at you once). One you come out the sky is still painfully textureful, the school tendriling into it.

Because there’s so much of you, you dissolve into so many other things, things which could never possibly cohere into one person).

      *       * so how do you take care? what do you need to take care of, take care--off? that is, what steps can you take to resolve what has happened?
List of Care
      1. write a lot, as you’re already doing. when you’re done start making video art and painting. you are currently fairly successfully prioritizing this. 
      2. sleep - who knows. I don’t think it’s feasible to try and get trazadone again. You need to stick to waking up a few hours earlier to entrain yourself. An automated  SAD/red lamp cycle would be ideal, but you can’t get that any time soon. Maybe you try to use cannabutter again...
      3. be hydrated - water bottle? this usually doesn’t work, because you don’t like those. Just remembering, prioritizing the intent to keep a glass of water close and keep sipping it. Be liberal and generous with your tea. MORE HOT TEA FUCKER. 
      4. eat better - soylent, free food, dad… You can try to figure out what the soylent servings actually are… apparently one cup of soylent and two cups of water is the right amount? The bag is only four meals, which is still a certain fair amount. Shop for perogi, lasagna, etc. 
      5. exercise - daily - first thing in the morning before meditating, and first thing coming into the house
      6. medidate  - daily - likewise
      7. keep taking vitamins
      8. have a certain amount of hugs, but not too much. 
      9. prioritize sunlight. try bundling up and sitting outside during the few daylight hours. Also stare at lamps. 
      10. when dad comes, get massages, reiki  and lamp
      11. talking somehow sometimes makes things easier if you know what to say, as do herbs and incense sometimes. TALK TO YOURSELF.
the mind and tongue and fingers and keyboard (physical organs each of the same level) do change with familiarity. you are not of this world (there was a moment while you trippin when you described a laura in this way and they collectively seemed to lash out at you, insisted you were hallucinating when really you were simply describing a banal thing about personalities and fashion. only shlomo listened, blessed their seemingly playacting heart). you are not of this world in that you have been away for a really long time and in this moment are also dissociated (writer’s trance, brian calls it), that dissolution when you’re working on something when you no longer exist at all not even as a bunch of other things like during ego death type experiences but here it’s not even that, those other things that you might be don’t exist either; only the world exists (and if you’re tripping it can be all polymorpheos like those greek vaguely water deities - the old man of the sea, or Rhea, or Metis - and different in your place).

Right now we are going to talk through what whe doing. Staring at lights and talkiong to yourself are important things, mild ones but you need to do all of them simply because the doing the action with the right mindset potentiates the otherwise mild effects into significantly potent ones (it’s not just playacting, you have to have something to potentiate for this work; like grapefruit juice and methylphenidate: witchcraft, a performance art, and care practices is the grapefruit juice and methylphenidate, the tums and amphetamine, the black pepper and turmeric.)


WHAT WE ARE DOING is reading through the other stuff, and coming up with a solution. What we’re gonna do here. It might, as Laura mentioned, involve encouraging them to get support elsewhere. It probably involves helping concrete things like aromatherapy and communes. It probably involves appreciating them loudly. It will eventually involve renegotiating boundaries and distance. It involves talking about poly stuff, it involves fixing the things that don’t work between us, I have an utopian hope that in the eventual faraway future it involves a full support group (the man with no face has insomnia from using sedatives to sleep after the perpetual anxiety  and panic attacks (which also gives them chronic pain) which are at least partially due to the adderall for depression which is at least partially from not sleeping and not eating properly, also partially caused by adderall. god knows what lithium does, too; there’s a question about how to ride through the actual manic and depressive episodes that are involved here which would be involved here, how to deal with crises, but that’s another lesson to be learned, after the fact, how to deal with mental breakdowns in general. that one has self-esteem)

On the other hand, you force yourself to acknowledge in that almost classical move of anarchist postmodernists that the evil bad thing isn’t actually all that bad, that Ginsburg ain’t singing their praises for nothing, that both the rocking and rolling (not the genre; clearly this was about aspie-ass stimming and MDMA. you post this in a totally different format, “rocking and rolling (stimming and MDMA)”, and only now you really realize the difference that the long form makes, the different sort of wit that doesn’t really involve brevity, or at least not in the same way.), both the rocking and rolling and the yellow morning are valuable and ecstatic in their own right, you heternormative capitalism patriarchial asshole (formost to yourself) with your internalized notions of goodness and so on and so forth *sniff*. The reality of this thing is that it’s not perfect but you’re steadily getting better and this does represent a pretty good jump forward with some pretty serious parts. Obviously there’s gonna be a lot of unsatisfying parts because of the quanitity and lack of filtering, but even those parts are worthwhile; you can’t get amazing and intresting without learning uninteresting first. So read on.

you have to write urgently and joyfully, you feel dead today compared to tomorrow but you have to sieze and double down on all of the witchcraft of this process on all of the witchcraft invovled and required to live on, to live on in a real and non-chemical based way, in a real life magical mystical superlative excstaticness that will actually possess you to a graetness.

but maybe you can’t actually do the entirity of the great vividness right now. Maybe you need to wait, maybe you need to get away with drugs for today and try to do further mysticisism in future weeks with better sleep and more serious energy.

witchcraft invovles a surprising amount of simple math. You’re very glad to finally have exact dosages for your acid, but now you don’t know if 15mcg is good or not for today. You don’t know quite how the dosage worked; Nadi suggests that the whole thing with it being potentiated by 5-htp isn’t true; rather, 5-htp makes acid weaker because acid directly agonizes seratonin receptors rather than augmenting seratonin production. Writing is very difficult, you have to do so much of wt, just describe banal events, just getting the words out, one word after the other onto the page, to end up with anything worthwhile. You had so many myriad ideas last night, and where exactly are you now? Comparatively dead; the little thought-fragments (nor the shitposts) explode into great paragraphs of flowering hybrid roses and god knows what other flora (at some point in your newfound witchiness you do want to learn how to cultivate a real garden, grow shrooms and mint and lavender and saint john’s wort and valerian), they don’t explode like that any more, they just sit there and you stare at them in frustration because now you’re sober and kind of dead and yeah you stupid druggie you ain’t fucking above all the other druggies just because you’re so fucking enlightened and therapeutic and “non-recreational” with your drugs (sure, you aren’t just nodding of with them, you are actually doing and being in the world, but you’d do the same with meth, and you have no pretenses about that). Why wouldn’t you be addicted - not in base, but in superstrucutre - to phenibut and ritalin? They’re both habit forming, after all, and what a great habit you’ve formed.
%split%
The truth here however isn’t about the drugs themselves, it’s about what youwere doing, and it is immensely hard to get there without them , but you can; set and setting, darling, witchcraft is a performance art, and if your perforamnce is powerful enough you can do anything. Laius told you this so many times ago; you had no belief for him, so that part of him was literally tinkerbell.
%split%
Yesterday, last night, was really a seperate trip unto itself. You laptop keeps lagging, wifi keeps dying, what the fuck do you do with it? There wasn’t any hallucinogens yesterday, not really, but it still did something, and while a good part of that wonderful thought bubble can be attributed to the ritalin crash, phenibut and weed are apt enough by themselves, too, if kind of boring on their own. 
%split%
One of the many tihngs, so many many many things you saw last night, was this one: spirits. You can’t even begin to explain the whole thing of it, the vibrance and explosion of the thing, the “diastole”, the intense unfurling contained in a single thought-fragment that didn’t promise a whole novel’s worth of brilliant  in itself, but was immediately apparent, beyond the question of belief that the notion of promise involves in itself, a promising beyond any question of faith: when the angel comes down to you and stops your hand or whatever it is them angels do (you’d know if you actually read the bible you pretend to know so much about soemtimes) the very idea of Pascal’s wager becomes inconcievable; sooner visualize all the verticies of a five-dimensional hypercube here, than doubt the whole viviacity of thoughts during that trip. 
%split%
Anyway, though. yesterday you learned a bit about how to tell a story, there on the couch; perhaps it is worth something-or-other, maybe worth the while  to recount the whole etiological drama of how things came about (here’s a real mythology for you. You wonder, what is the difference between a mythos and a mythology? Logic? Psychos and psychology, astres and astrology?). 
%split%
Anyway. This started a few days ago, when you were caught by the realization of multiple personalities. Part of this was painfully mainfest during the trip itself
(remember the “daelic” in psychadaelic doesn’t just mean manifesting the soul, but also creating it. Suggestibility works both ways; your insides leak into the world around you, coloring everything with a thousand vivids, but the world also leaks into you, changing you in so many ways. Now, sober, you are no longer sure if witchcraft can really properly exist elsewhere. Certaintly not when sleep deprived. (you’re cast yourself off from DFW, either in the name of snobby superioirity or in the name of needing google docs to include your assides in its word count, which it doesn’t for footnotes, and so use parentheses quite literally instead, one-for-one. It takes a while to liber up into writing, a while to get to anything like the state of mind you have after condescing a week or two’s worth of writing into a single day. 80 / 20 much?)
)
%split%

multiple personalities, since you disintegrated totally and were myriad  spitis, those of your family and friends and all the souls of the dead, &c, whatever. Later on as you came in to your own with the witchiness - and you do want to go back afterwords, figure out when exactly you started becoming a witch, when the seeds were planted, maybe blame Ashly Obscura for it or something, maybe blame Aetshak, who has so many different names now, note the magic and reterritorilizaiton of names and the deterroitorlization of the multiple names, Seperioth, and somewhat in the same vein go back and also mark how the drugs started happening; there’s an accelerationism for you, as the more drugs you do the more you read about drugs and the more you do again; will the singularity simply be an overdose?
%split%

you came into your own with the witchiness, and a thought crossed your mind: do you ge to have familiars now? You thought this thought biking up somewhere along l’esplanade near the parcs of Parc, dark, leaves, light, shadows, and dismissed this thought for a moment because it seemed like one of those vain, essentially dogmatic adornemnts that come with the language or the ideology of whatever acutally effective tool you’re going for (like, you take something effective - medicine, or witchcraft, or yoga, or poetry - and there’s something to its essence, the actuality of the thing, the part that really does the work, and then usually there’s the accompagning language, which is useful in its own right (see your second semester’s thoughts on language, as well as what Rob told you about why Heiddigger translated into Steve Roggenbuck’s lexicon or that of Teen Surf Goth would be a fascinating piece of art but a poor piece of philosophy), but is often filled with unncessary frills and cruft which distracts you from the core effectiveness of what you’re doing, makes you more liable to burn out in frustration that it doesn’t work well enough. So you abandoned it for a moment, the thought of familiar spirits, and noticed your euphamisim for your bipolor, your cyclothymia: Janus, a sort of two-faced thing, a macro from a few months ago (here, time is made very flat, so that all things happen sort of at the same time but not literally because you can’t represent that at all, but this document is one of the few places where everything can sort of happen at the same time and still cohere. The other such places are, of course, the extremity of the hallucination, when you think so many things at quite the same time, and the conversation, where the interruption of the assosiated thought also deterritorilizes the whole thing, yet the fact of physically talking with anothe rperson grounds allows it to cohere in a consistency, the consistency being that you are the same two people with all of the assortedly said thoughts hanging between you and in each one’s short-term memeory)
%split%
Janus, I tell you, dancing with his own other half, is the only way a cyclothymiac can learn how to survive. This puts the question: when you have two faces, two essences, how do you live with yourself? This is the part where you had a really great epiphany, that one of the faces was extremely excited to be alive, to have done so many fucking things finally you’ve wanted to be viviedly alive for months and months now and now you are again and you can breath the same air and think the same tenor and register and vibrancy of thought as all the other times you were manic and live, finally, get on with this witchcraft, get on with a great health, Nietzsche’s or healthgoth, whatever, same thing, even Hela Trol Pis’ sikhealth concepts, finally live forever manic―

all the other miracles of the past day, of the past days of the past month dwindle in comparison, and let you tell me, there was helluvolot of miracles. You were as productive yesterday as you were in the past two weeks despite being heavily traumatized. You literally learned a very real essence of magic; butterflies are more similar to capitalis than you are to yourself a moment ago. And all of this means nothing, compared to this fact: you caught yourself. Manya, as you decide to call it after a passing cyrliic homophonia, was about to sacrifice your own self to live for a few hours more, like you did ever
single
other
time
and now you caught him, did an actual truely miraculous witchcraft: got him to bed. you were literally manic for a moment, but you didn’t overcommit, you prioritized care, you went to bed - on time! you didn’t let yourself get distracted, you did all of the fucking self care you need to have that mania again today, hopefully, for a few hours, a sustability that means infinitel ymore than any of your current achievemnts. You’ve had other interesing peaks in the past, but all of those were inherently phyrric. The notion of beign able to start win long-term is infinitely more, a higher cardinality. Even that time you healed yourself, when you were stricken to be hospitalized for six weeks and you healed yourself in a day or three and Laius told you insistently it was a miracle, even that in a certain sense doesn’t mean as much as this sort of step towards ‘sustainability’, and the word is a sort of prostitute (like yourself), but this one is stripped of meaning by neoliberal nonsense, “director of sustainability”, etcetra. Here you mean something totally different, a signified that happens to overshadow its signifier, and here it is not our signifiers that drift polysemically, but the multifarious signified that needs a thousand signifiers, a structuralist take on Sepherioth. Think about the word, biowitch. Think about a thousand different words. Each of them has a tiny shred of where it’s actually at, you know. This is the sustainability that is perversevence, you need to stop using the word sustainability here, it is becoming unstainable t b h, it’s about an endurence or robustness or recalcitrance or even trust, trust in yourself, trust in a future (remember to trust your instincts; stop referring to the outside world, stop always checking your trip against what people say, stop looking for external markers of success and all; trust your insistincts, the world and the instincts are trying to teeach them, you have to pay very great attention for it all to work. reverse gaslighting.) Trust in the real possibility of a future that endures. This concept has something extremely powerful to it that you do need to reterroritolize or cohere into a word, such as that you be able to summon it in the past. Words and names both limit the “potential” of a spirit (when spirits are fuzzy nameless mind idea things), but also give it potency of use, allow it to be invoked. Pan eimei pharmakon.

You might benefit quite a bit from talking to Nadi about spirituality, talking to a bunch of people about their gods and similar things. Even Tony, that actual lying, cheating, manipulative asshole, had something here with his low-key white supremacist pagan bullshit, even he had something to it, and you should remember that the vikings used poetry as their magic, that their poetry was a way to remember and to command.

even in the worst case, you still have to be together, be a person. what are you going to do now? even in the worst case - exist. you have a relationship to art, it is a similar relationship to eva, and it is a similar relationship - one that you could, if you were very misguided, reduce to the words “ absolute obligation”, but it goes very far beyond that, it is an impossibility of doing anything else which has nothing in common with ‘obligation’ - to the world. you must continue existing, you must not fall apart even in the worst case, you must continue to take care, you must develop the same relationship with witchcraft, et cetera.

%split%
in the worst possible case, you must face it, you must face it and keep your life together, finish writing, finish the semester, continue eating, continue sleeping, continue meditating, most importantly continue to make art of all of the kinds, and not kid yourself in it, not make trivial art to distract yourself, but art that gets at the core of the subject (remember, when you were talking up the escalators to heaven the people’s potato? of course the base, the somatic, the body, the “real” world is of prime importance and all of your priorities should be around that pragma, but art and maybe in fact the novel is the privileged way to influence it, to practice witchcraft, to change the ideology), face yourself with the life and live it out longer.

That, of course, is the worst possibility, and fairly unlikely at this point, if the man with no face is with their mother. if they’re hospitalized, they’re almost definitely not going to die, although they are sure to traumatized. if they’re with their mother, it seems like it might be very bad with their own, abusive, Laius, but not quite as bad as that? There’s more chances of them getting really creative and dying, though. You will have to say things to them, not just muck around with essential oil nonsense. Speaking of which..
%split%
But. Yeah. What are you going to tell them? Should you go back and re-examine yourself? There’s all the banal stuff, yes, encouraging them to get support elsewhere, appreciating them loudly, all that other utopistic nonsense… but here? What do say when someone asks you for a reason to live?


%split%


Right now, though, you should really focusedly get on with your witchiness. Seems like that’ll help more than anything else. However, you can’t really properly do witch things when you’re all calified, when you can’t think properly, when you keep not unfurling, and this is why you have to sleep so so carefully, this is why you have to care so mucking much about that all the time. Because otherwise there is no magic at all to speak of. In this moment, you have to liber up, you have to write with a lot of intent, and focus, and… power, in a sense, a power that comes from its own being used -- “use it or loose it!” that asshole gym teacher screams across time. Gym teachers, I think, are personally responsible for a great deal of suicide.

So then the thoughts from the last time. You already (by neccessity) have mirages of life after novel (does the novel grow meloncholy at this? have you abandoned the novel as protagonist? what a meanie )now you have interruptions from all the facebook friends who visit you inside your deep-spilling mind((

%split%

these mirage include coping with finals - an essay - after all this, a religious reading - no, not catholicism - the microscopic, molecular religion of ideology in spare moments, the religion of seeing, how Fowler in The Quiet American describes the internal world of falling, the different gadients or tone sof the internal landscape, that is ‘religion’, in my sense, especially with the fact that observing cannot possibly be neutral - certaintly not in a novel. “something missing - Unknown knows - ideology” memory truncates zizek - the philosopher dude around Voina, anarchist art group precursor to Pussy Riot, “To Sing With Mind”, has something similar about philosophers as fillers of epistemic lacuna, very dicky, This mind turns visual. Maybe that’s a protagonist, maybe the falling-away of narrative concerns throughout our journy here wasn’t quite a bad thing. Everyone was so concerned about narratives - Kousu kept talking about them, the podcast with bee-tamers about everyone who didn’t believe in the story - sure, stories are important, and you can make life flow around them, but that word, “narrative”, does impose a lot with it, and once you start talking with it you’re so caught up in escaping or negating it that you forget to live or shape your own life, forget to take the chance to live it out, who knows. That one, just like you drew out in your little could-have-done-it-in-fivetene-minutes-but-spent-4-hours film, just like the teacher commented back at you recently, is also a narrative (techincally, though nobody ever thinks to mean that;the rule of the signifier has a sort of one-sidedness to it, sorry Cixous), this passage from concern with and rejection of narrative to an indifference towards and deprioritization of narrative. It goes with the graph magic you didn’t think to write aobut it because it seemed like a boring math at the time. 
Then, between the mirage of futurity or its essays and the anxiety of conclusions, a real truth (different from that of Andres, “don’t be so cynical” “of course you’re an idealist!” (another, more disappointing truth of drugs - hella fucked up coordination; feel sorry the man with no face’s benoz withdrawls - no, sorry is not the word, is a this-worldly word; what you feel - no, not feel, further than that - what you - are? - is to remorse as weltschmerz is to irritation. how does a german philosophize, mr. sapir?), somehow he took three world-shattering events - well, no, not world-changing either - nothing at all has changed of the world, yet no part of this one has anything but a surface similarity to the world of last week (to write after autschitz is impossible”, obviosly nothing to do with auschitz, but youare writing, are you not? what was meant?) and so three times: soul, death, art, each totally unexpected and essentially unrelated to the signifiying words (that is, the socially established connotation of those words, the socially-agreed signified of that is the most proximate to the one intended here, but hopelessly distant) 

%split%

(writing seriously is more dififcult than doing it carelssly. you feel obligated, now, in the sense you are not obligated to do art or believe in god but simply must, in the social sense of the word, to do serious art. how the signifier does end up misleading you, no matter how much you hate platonists.)

they keep shattering, fragmented, every day of this rain, glazed skyscraper grids and “>this isn’t even bait” streetlamps and trees (windowfrost branch or headphone knotted, silhouet or backdrop) and all the fucking tones of the sky, fuck. this one, a real sight, happens by itself, unlaboured.

in this side, of the novel, of the anxiety, two seperate thoughts, concluding that fragment earlier there, “afriend reads your work exaltatingly”: your selfies get so many likes. you get to be a girl now! back an awkward-ass autism (therefore socially masc, wot?), three-four likes were surprising, the fifty-like girl’s slefies, derision-worthy. but now you yourself are here, enjoying it (and certaintly, body image culture is toic af, you have somewhat taken that and the neccessity of demolisting the heteronromative partraitchal  racist transmisogynist capitalist society along with any authoriterian, toteletarian, and fascist tendencies witihn or without it for granted, a fact that might perhaps be lost somewhere in the all the personal feelings shit, but whatever - molar macroscopic politics seem increasingly a scam; feels are where it’s at, that’s where affinity shows through. besides: y’all “for the rev!” commies, in the real ultimate sense if you try to peel back the layers of social capital and milieu infighting, can be doing it either out of morals or longwinded egoism (both valid). personal, immediate morality matters so much more to you (me, the author, here) than the longwinded future utopias (not bc they’re utopias - idealist optimism is indispensible, if alongside nihilist cynicism - but bc they totalize); egoism, personal interest, though obviously allied with full luxury space communism and whatever welfare state harm reduction reformism the liberals will come up with next, is still better served by robbing the bank or CEO (genocide - a little death, all the infinite exploitation - a little theft? the sex worker wonders lacuna. *sniff*), or better yet - communes, serving both, just like Bentam or whoever it was wanted

the friend (you’ve sort of stopped paying attention to most of the formal elements you initially delighted in, allusive names and section titles, gimmicks of personhood, etc) loved your work, practically heaped all those envious childhood praises on it, made a passing comment about obbseessive millenial selfies (which are, you suppose, truely to blame for this auto/biographical nonsense. maybe if you hadn’t dropped that class this novel would have been a something else, a miracle, changing the nature of this world also, but thinking about it will give you just about nothing at all. Save it - since your whole consciousness effectively autosaves in these howevermany hundread pages - for if you ever have to drop classes again)
and this is a selfie, anyway, is what you’re saying, and it does seem now that it might get a bunch of praise (and, as Petulence, the transition team horseman between Pestilence and Pollution, showed - vitriol), given how speicific and polarizing your shitpost niche is. this isn’t actually nearly as profound as you might think, you thought, but then you think more. the truly meritous shitpost, be it through ingenuus elegence or sheer effort, never gets the likes it should; the selfie always gets more. thus the conundrum of “shoulds”, Herr Doktor Doktor Polakoff (you dumbass don’t be cruel, you sham for a witch).

it still isn’t anything actually that far worth exploring, though, simply because the reception of your art, as immensely as it affects your future art, does kinda pale in comparison to the other stuff you need to work through. we’ll add the crises of reception (which will obviously happen, the ego and the reception do direct quite a bit of the future) in an addendum. Anxiety and mirage, mirage and anxiety. How much do you care to like dialectics, eh? The dude who biked from Oakland to MTL for anarchist bookfair to stutter all the really not insignificant insight “of” anarchist nihilism (of in scare quote; anarchist nihilism is not a unified thing, hence insights can’t be of it, but both the insights and the anachicism and the nihlism are real) was so against him, it spoils your taste.

 essence, there are three things left: witch scribbles, format-editing prognosis AKA form AKA graph magic (which does also have to include, in the future-directed sense, a serious conclusion about the man with no face, and this - during tomorrow tbh), and wrap-up shitpost type things. But really, if you carry out your rhizomatization well enough, you don’y think it really has an ending as such, even that NaNoWriMo be over; the reader travels through text of their own accord, and you don’t really think anyone is going to read it to cover to cover - that’s so last millennium. Besides, the reader’s life doesn’t end any more than yours does, so these end-of-life anxieties (there, the spirit of the novel is finally rousing itself, eh?) are kind of silly. You go on, the reader goes on, this book stays with them one way or another. Take a page from all those chuck tingle characters, yeah? 
%split%
it strikes you that you may be condemned to a very similar fate as chuck tingle. maybe you should try asking him to look at this? or what if you turned this in, to that ridiculous person, the robot, claiming that it represennted what you term paper on chuck tingle had become (bearing the same motifs of existentialism, sexuality, being fucking gay, having unworthwhile narrative, and lavish pop-surrealist or pop-postmodernist energies)
%split%

the narrative part, as you consider the inclusion of the images you contiunually allude to  once you stop worrying about word counts, could be augmented by including not only the memes and shit you talk about, not only the not uninteresting if quite amateurish photography, but also really serious art, macros as well as something in the vein of  the a thousand plateaus drawings ( certainly that makes sense if you do tackle the problem of re/presenting deleuze ), not to mention the collabs with the man with no face. if steve roggenbuck gets to publish a book of selfies and poems, why can’t you publish one rhizomes and three-titted portraits?
anyway
%split%


(wait, no, another consideration about form: despite what you’ve said about DFW (as well as nabokov or whatever), you are effectively overloading the footnote, a medievial artifact, into the rhizome. there’s that aspect, as well as the formal stratification of passages - memes, advice, descriptions, aestheticing, existentialism, etc)

what happened here is that you drew a tracery of your idea in your head, scribbled it in crayon onto a papper as you made yourself pass out. there’s probably a better word for what it is: mnemoitic, ritual carving, mind map, sigil, wot…? this one is exactly a basterdization.

(some sort of third element of the triangle that you know exists because you mnemorized it visually, the shape of the connections, but can’t remembre it - something about the style of retorritilizations and deterorrilization applied with dialectic fludity, maybe? but probably it was actually a pun, maybe just psycha”dealic” (you know: daelic, manifesting the soul into the world, but manifesting the world intoyour soul, making the soul also maybe, something like that?)

sacrifice: My witchcraft, you think angry-intense-distracted fumbling door key, memory of bike rush backforth pedle wobble streetdark leaf mind rush on arms and leggs, will not have sacrifices. Well, not sure how priorities work - the previous moment had a great big thought about priorities, that the sense of enacting the absolute priority, the sort of absolute relation (like to art, or now the man with no face, or now god) to something in particular for a moment is an extremeist is an witchcraft is a miraclemaking. It needs a different name, but both the absolute priority and the partial knowledge hallucination control epeiphanies’s invest-everything attitude is the smae and extremely powerful thing.
This doesn’t go all that well with no sacrifices, but you can sort of have both at the same, just like you have everything at the same time. You have to go soon; this one is also a social obligation. But for another second, you do have to have both a witchcraft of no sacrifices and a miraclemaking of absolute maximalistic priorties. And I mean, no human sacrifices; you can’t sacrfice people, can’t sacrifice another. The problem is that you don’t see yourself as a person, don’t see yourself as an other.

these things that you have not happened to properly include in the novel are still within your continuity as if you had written then into the novel, except without the effect of reterritorilized naming, of labels or concreteness, a sort of unknown known. when you think (and thinking, psychē, is just another way to say spirit) without writing, it stays with you in its most open form, maybe most pregnant form, but is lost as soon as spirits change (spirits here as microscopic zeitgeist, prevailing moods)
%split%
the thought maps are especially meta in representing different thoughts as chains, not only the thought but also the motion, and the several concomitant motions. yet the isolation of that enthused, wandering-body wandering-mind rambling, even into mental pictures let alone lines on a page, is still a reterritorilization
%split%
when thinking out loud (or, y'know, mentally) "sorta", "like", etc, are not only filler words but also an epistemic shorthand or sketch-style, filling in enough of rough concept to allow the full form to be retrieved or finished later, with a deterritorilizating vagueness that opens up the meaning if whatever approximation happens to follow the "like", "sorta", makes it into a polysemy
%split%
what you miss, tho, with maps and pictures and rambling mental or verbal, is the taste and texture and tenor and trill of words themselves. it is both a jailhouse and a liberty. do note: the pharmakon is not a synthesis of cure and poison, burn something beyond both.

[conversations--rhizomes]
your thought lines still tend towards trees, there is not actually rhizomes (conversations are rhizomatic through their branching… no, that's arborescent; they are rhizomatic because all of the branches happen at once and through the switching from one branch to another, made into a place of consistency through the miserable magic of linear time and personhood), they are all rooted in the lived experience, sprouting out in abstract from it. That’s how you might send it to Bryan Sentes, call it a close reading of life or something.

there is another big fullness, to figure out both trees-fungi you drew, to unfurl them. you’d like to do it, it is so enchanting, sometimes so pretty. you think, ‘thinking is a dirty habit’. maybe you should cesse this here? you have to go out and on, write down what you learned here (you learned really quite a lot), figure the future. maybe skretch out those trees for us, briefly, they might sprout in the month of edits; perhaps you wuill have learned something off this miracle of four-day hyperfocus; learning to live on like this would really be something, woudln’t it.

from the previous one, the parts you really have to focus on and suck through anyway are about the named spirits, naming the spirits, figuring out how this is for you, and maybe that you might have to do soon, although it might have to wait until you come back here and trip again because you don’t seem to have any sort of multiple personality thing sober, really, or not often, but it is still alovely thing to think. most briefly - the various things you say are quite different at differnt times, youare quite different people, and some of them might have names. you can use left/right brain, personality times, even Zoe and Zelda nonsense to describe the alternations, but the Lesser Key of Solomon is just as good - at least, there was a moment of fear when it seemed like if you weren’t careful you’d actually invite one of them in, or have a bad trip anyways. Priorities were also there, priorities and sacrifices, and you’ve spoken about this without figuring it out.
